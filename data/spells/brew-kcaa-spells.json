				"As part of casting this spell, you cobble together a device from your supply of small parts and components you usually reserve for the creation of custom spellcasting foci. You place a spell effect into this device, drawing it forth at a later time as an action. The device becomes a spell-storing item for the duration of this spell; in effect a consumable magic item with a single charge which only you can activate.",
				"Choose a first level spell from any class spell list. The spell-storing item must incorporate raw materials (usually Eberron dragonshards) worth the same amount of gold as the chosen spell's expensive material components (if any) at the time you imbue the spell into the item. The spell's attack bonus and/or save DC is determined by your spellcasting ability at the time you imbue the spell into the spell-storing item. If you do not activate the spell-storing item before this spell's duration expires, then the stored spell is lost and the custom spellcasting focus becomes useless.",
				"Creating a spell-storing item is a difficult and dangerous process. When this spell's casting time is complete, you make an Arcana check; the difficulty is 13 + twice the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell. If you fail, your casting time and costly raw materials are wasted but you do not expend the spell-slot used to cast this spell. However, on a failure you suffer a mishap; this is usually an unintended effect determined by the DM, or it might merely inflict {@dice 2d6} damage on you. This damage cannot be reduced by any means.",

						"Higher spell levels are even more dangerous to work with; if you take damage due to suffering a mishap, you take {@dice 2d6} damage per spell level of the spell slot you were attempting to cast from (for example, a failed attempt at using a 3rd level spell slot to imbue a spell-storing item with a fly effect might deal you {@dice 6d6} damage, if the DM doesn't decide on some other consequence).",
