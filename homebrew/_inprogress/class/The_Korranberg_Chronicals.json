						"The world of Eberron is populated by many of the same fantastical races as other Dungeons and Dragons worlds, but through the lens of pulp action or noir intrigue these races are reexamined and given a fresh new look. Are gnomes whimsical practical jokers, or scheming cutthroats? Are orcs brutal savages, or noble protectors of nature? In this chapter, rules are given for playing Dungeons and Dragons races with variant mechanics for capturing the feel of an Eberron campaign, or to expand on the options given to that race in the Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron. Races are divided in three categories.",
						"{@bold 1. Common Folk}. These are the races most frequently seen in the Five Nations of Khorvaire, the main continent of the Eberron campaign setting. A peasant running into one of these folk may not give the occurrence a second thought, and if they do it is because their attitudes depend on past experience with these races (for example, shifters are often mistrusted in more civilized settlements, and typically given a wide berth by strangers as if they were avoiding a stray dog).",
						"{@bold 2. Uncommon Folk}. These races are not unheard of, but it is uncommon to see them walking openly in most civilized settlements in the Thronehold Nations. While everyone knows that a warforged is, and can recognize them on sight, their numbers are still far less than the humans, dwarfs, half-elves, and other peoples of the Five Nations, so to see one is still a notable occurrence.",
						"{@bold 3. Rare Folk}. These races are extremely rare in civilized Khorvaire. Most commoners may never see one in their lifetime, or if they do they may mistake them for another more common race (such as ass uming a kalashtar or an aasimar is merely a beautiful human, or that eladrin are merely another ethnic group of elves). Some folk may not even know these races exist at all.",
						"Races are presented here in the same format as the Player's Handbook. Refer to page 17 of that book for more about choosing a race for your character."

										"The changelings of Eberron are an enigmatic race of shapeshifters. Descended from doppelgangers and, presumably, humans, changelings have evolved into their own separate race, distinct from either heritage. Their ability to completely change their appearance at will lends them the potential to be consummate spies and criminals, and many changelings live up to that image.",
										"While open changeling communities are quite rare, changelings themselves are spread out and fairly common in the Five Nations. So much so, that it is often standard practice for other people to associate themselves with a signature piece of jewelry or article of clothing—something distinctive enough to identify themselves as who they are, since changelings can’t mimic clothing and accessories.",
										"Changelings adventurers come from a variety of backgrounds: They might be running from a criminal past, pursuing revenge, or seeking spiritual perfection through the use of their shapeshifting abilities. Some may be adventurers simply due to a lack of other palatable options: Changelings not inclined toward stealth or crime find their race's stereotype working against them.",

										"Most dwarves, even those not in the dragonmarked House Kundarak, are preoccupied with displays of wealth. Dwarves are completely capable of falling in love with objects and are more likely to do so the flashier and more valuable they are.", 
										"{@bold Subraces}. In Eberron, the most likely subraces to be encountered are the Hill Dwarf ( , pg. 20) and the Mark of Warding subrace (Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron, pg. 108) for dragonmarked dwarves. Hill dwarves represent the vast majority of the dwarven population of Khorvaire, while dwarves of the dragonmarked Kundarak lineage lucky enough to manifest a mark gain the Mark of Warding.", 
										"Additionally, Duergar ({@book Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes, pg. 81|mtf}) are native to the continent of Sarlona, typically in the Tashana Tundra region. Unlike in the core cosmology of D&D, the Duergar of the Tashana Tundra coexist with other dwarves. They live in a mixed society called the Akiak. Because of their location and history in Sarlona, Duergar know the Riedran language instead of Common. The sight of a Duergar in Khorvaire would be exceedingly uncommon.",
										"The Mountain Dwarf subrace is exceptionally rare in Eberron, as the dwarves are not especially known for their amazing prowess in battle. A Mountain Dwarf character is likely to be the most naturally gifted warrior to come from the Mror Holds in generations."

										"While a great many elves live among the Five Nations, the rarer sight of a golden Aereni death mask or a Valenar veil obscuring an elven visage hints as the diversity of elven people. Subraces. The Mark of Shadow elf subrace (Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron, pg. 105) can manifest on any elf that shares a bloodline with the line of Phiarlan or Thuranni (itself formerly a lineage of House Phiarlan). This typically occurs on elves from Khorvaire, but the Mark has been known to spontaneously manifest on foundlings from Aerenal or Valenar. The Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron also details a variant rule for bringing the unique elven cultures of Aerenal and Valenar into the game. Presented below are fully fledged subraces that embrace these cultures, plus the cosmopolitan elves of the Five Nations, and make them fully distinct from the elves of other campaign settings. If your game uses these new subraces, it is recommended that they replace the High Elf and Wilf Elf subraces found in the . Finally, the drow and eladrin of Eberron are considered separate races for all mechanical purposes (for instance, they cannot manifest the Mark of Shadow). These races are detailed in later sections of this chapter."

Tairnadal elves escaped Xen'drik to Aerenal along with those who founded the Undying Court, but they practice a different form of ancestor worship. Descended from the brave warrior elves who fought the giants with spell and blade, the Tairnadal believe the only way to honor them is to emulate their battles in the present day. The Valaes Tairn, the largest Tairnadal tribe, has even gone so far as to invade Khorvaire and establish the nation of Valenar, seeking any and every battle to bring glory to the Spirits of the Past. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1. Alignment. Though their honor-bound warrior culture tends toward neutrality, many of the less scrupulous, evil Valenar do not care who their opponents are, so long as they die hard and the fight is glorious. Tairnadal Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the double scimitar, scimitar, longbow, and shortbow. Fleet of Foot. Your base walking speed is 35 feet. Born in the Saddle. The Valenar revere their mounts as much as their ancestors, even tracing horse lineages back to the mounts their ancient heroes rode into battle against the Giants. Few on Eberron could claim to be their equal in mounted combat. Mounting or dismounting a horse costs you only 10 feet of movement, instead of half your walking speed. You never fall off your mount if it is moved against its will, and you cannot be knocked prone while mounted. If your mount is knocked prone, you can dismount it and land on your feet without using your reaction. 







Gnomes are harmless industrious folk... or so they want people to think. The gnomish homeland of Zilargo attained its independence from Breland at the start of the Last War by announcing itself an ally of Breland. It seems no one realized that Breland surrendered the sovereignty it previously held over the territory in the process. It was also the gnomes of House Sivis that anticipated the commercial impact of Dragonmarks and formed them into an extended network of industrial monopolies. Gnomes might be small and jovial, but they are far more cunning and shrewd than they let on. Subraces. In the world of Eberron, gnomes essentially come from one of two origins: the nation of Zilargo, or the mysterious Feyspires. These are detailed below. The Mark of Scribing gnome subrace (Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron, pg. 103) manifests within the population of Zil gnomes, from those sharing a blood relation to the families of House Sivis. Rock Gnomes do not exist in Eberron, and those wishing to play a gnome with the ability to create clockwork items are encouraged to play one of the below gnome subraces. They can then select a class or background that grants proficiency in any kind of artisan’s tools, and pick Artificer’s tools, detailed in a Chapter 4: Equipment. 

The gnomes of Zilargo have a long and ancient tradition of guile and subterfuge. Though one would not guess to look at it, the peaceful surface of Zilargo is a status quo that runs on intrigue and scheming. While a human might find such conditions intolerable, the psychology of the gnomes is such that they seem most comfortable in this type of society. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1. Alignment. Zilargo is a very peaceful nation, leading the gnomes to have a strongly lawful bent. While a society bent toward subterfuge and espionage may lead some to believe there is a strong evil streak in Zil gnomes, there is no actual tendency toward it. Zil Guile. You have proficiency with the Deception and Insight skills. Zil Magic. You know the prestidigitation cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. 

The Feyspire of Pylas Pyrial was once a legend out of Zilargo's fairy tales. The gnomes of this fabled city featured in the oldest of Zil bed-time stories and morality tales—stories of mischievous heroes outwitting ugly, dumb brutes. But now, Pylas Pyrial has manifested in the middle of the gnome homeland, bringing the whimsical gnomish figures of folk tales with it into the real world. Fey-Touched. Feyspire gnomes are functionally immortal. You will never die of old age, but you may still perish due to harm or illness. Forest Friends. In all other ways, Feyspire gnomes use the Forest Gnome subrace traits from page 37 of the . 

Goblins have an ancient and storied history acting as the scouts, spies, and assassins of the Dhakaani Empire. But since the fall of ancient Dhakaan, goblins have spent long millennia suffering oppression and ill fortune. Though the ancient clans yet exist in secret, hiding until the true heirs of Dhakaan return once again to claim their services, most goblins live under the shadow of larger nations. Whether oppressed by the brutal cultures of Droaam and Darguun, or suffering the more civil ostracization of Thronehold nations, goblins are usually relegated to city slums and stick to their own. Racial Traits. The below goblin racial traits and subraces are customized for the world of Eberron and replace entirely the goblin traits found in Volo’s Guide to Monsters. 
Your goblin character shares a number of traits in common with all other goblins. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. Goblins reach adulthood shortly before a decade and live a little over half a century. Size. Goblins are roughly the same size as gnomes, though much more bestial in appearance. Your size is Small. Speed. Goblins are known as golin'dar in their native tongue, meaning "the quick people", because they are unusually swift for their size. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Goblinoid. You belong to one of the three major goblinoid races. Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Naturally Stealthy. You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin. Subrace. While the majority of goblins live in the cities of modern Khorvaire, the ancient Dhakaani clans have begun exploring the world. Choose one of these subraces. 
The most common goblinoid people the citizens of Khorvaire are familiar with, goblins are often downtrodden and pushed into poverty by a cycle of bigotry and criminal retaliation. These "city goblins" learn to anticipate danger and escape swiftly from it. It's a lucky goblin that finds the opportunity to become an adventurer and gain respect. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Nimble Escape. You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action on each of your turns. Street Cunning. Most goblins know to develop a strong fluency in body language, to know when threats from larger folk are coming. You have proficiency with the Insight skill, and your proficiency bonus is doubled on all Wisdom (Insight) checks you make. 
Among the most infamous of Dhakaani Clans were the "Silent Clans". Comprised entirely of goblins, the taarka'kesh ("Silent Wolves") and shaarat'kesh ("Silent Knives") were renowned for their skill and stealth. Dhakaani goblins may become adventurers in order to function as scouts for their clans, taking in the lay of the land and the changes in the political landscape since their millennia-long seclusion began. Others may just be driven by wanderlust, finally free from their underground homes for the first time in living history and eager to experience all Khorvaire has to offer. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1. Dhakaani Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the flail, plus the spiked chain (detailed in Chapter 4: Equipment). Silent as Shadow. You have spent nearly your entire life learning to hide your presence. You have proficiency with the Stealth skill, and your proficiency bonus is doubled on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make. Additionally, you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace. 

When elves first emigrated to Khorvaire, they found human nations expanding and solidifying their power. Fascinated by these people, many elves attempted to marry into their nobility. The elves anticipated that their longer-lived progeny would eventually supplant the human nobility but were disappointed with the results. They found their hybrid offspring to possess too many human qualities to be easily controlled and were astonished to find them bucking elven traditions. Eventually the elves acclimated to their new neighbors and, for the most part, kept to themselves. First-generation half-elves, those born from the union of an elf and a human, occurred less and less frequently. Nowadays, the most frequent half-elven births are bred true from half-elven parents, and these half-elves call themselves Khoravar, meaning "Children of Khorvaire" in the elvish language. Racial Traits. The below half-elf racial traits replace those found in the , to more readily present half-elven subraces. 
Your half-elf character has a number of traits they’ve inherited from their mixed lineage. Age. Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years. Alignment. Half-elves regardless of origin live in a largely human society. They tend toward no particular alignment. Size. Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Thanks to your elven blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of grey. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. Half-Elf Subraces. Unlike most campaign settings, there are four subraces of half-elves in Eberron: Khoravar and First-Generation half-elves detailed below, plus those who develop the Mark of Detection or Mark of Storm (Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron, pg. 96 and pg. 106 respectively). Choose one of these subraces. 
The khoravar see themselves as true natives of Khorvaire. Humans and elves both migrated to this land but came together to birth children never before seen in history. They have a strong cultural identity of socialization and hospitality, and no khoravar feels like an outcast just because of the blood that flows through their veins. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma and Dexterity scores each increase by 2. Charmingly Social. You have proficiency with the Persuasion skill. In addition, whenever you are in a settlement with a khoravar community, you may add your double your proficiency bonus on Charisma checks to find the best person to talk to for reliable hirelings, news, rumors, or gossip. Khoravar Cant. Over many generations, khoravar have mingled the languages of their forebearers more and more. When you speak, read, or write in Elvish, you can do so in a distinct dialect used only by Khoravar. This dialect is peppered by slightly archaic Common turns of phrase. When communicating in this dialect, only those who understand both Common and Elvish can understand you. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. 

Elves and humans have mingled in the society of the Five Nations and often are each other’s neighbors. While the elves of Khorvaire as a people nowadays keep their own company, it is not altogether uncommon to find first-generation half-elves resulting from an elf and a human coming together. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1. Skill Versatility. You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice. 
The first-generation half-elves described above assume that the human and elven parents were both citizens of the Five Nations—a cosmopolitan society to be sure. However, even more rare than these half-elves are those born to the elves or drow of foreign cultures. Often these half-elves are called "ill-born" by their non-human parents and are considered to have been cursed by their human blood. They are typically given the bare-minimum care and seen as second-class beings in the culture they are raised. When playing such a half-elf, replace the Skill Versatility trait of the first-generation half-elf traits with the following trait that corresponds to your nonhuman parent's culture: Aereni Elves. You gain the Traditional Proficiency trait of Aereni elves. Valenar Elves. You gain the Tairnadal Weapon Training and Fleet of Foot traits of Valenar elves. Vulkoori Drow. You gain the Keen Senses and Tribal Weapon Training traits of the Scorpion Tribes drow. Sulatar Drow. You gain the Arcane Training and Sulatar Weapon Training traits of the Sulatar. Umbragen Drow. You gain the Shadow Steps and Umbragen Weapon training traits of the Umbragen. 
 
Half-elves of this variant descended from drow cannot qualify for the dragonmarked options, as they are unrelated to the bloodlines of the half-elven Dragonmarked Houses. 
 
In the present day, most half-orcs in Khorvaire can trace their ancestry directly back to the Shadow Marches. Thousands of years ago, a second migration of humans reached the west coast oh Khorvaire, where they encountered the orcs of the Shadow Marches. Though initial contact was violent, over millennia the two people grew closer together, and it wasn't long before the first Jhorgun'taal, or "children of two bloods" were born. Punctuating the commingling of these two people, half-orcs and humans are the only two races to share a dragonmark. House Tharashk, the youngest of the Dragonmarked Houses, built itself to have a monopoly on dragonshard prospecting by exploiting the Mark of Finding. This caused an influx of gold and development to the coasts of the Shadow Marches and improved the standing of half-orcs and orcs in modern Khorvarian society. Nowadays, Half-Orcs are completely accepted in any civilized settlement, and are rarely looked down upon. A shifter is more likely to draw nervous glances than one of these folk. Unlike the khoravar half-elves, the half-orcs did not create their own distinct culture, instead embracing the position of being a bridge between orc and human peoples. Variant Statistics. Half-Orcs can largely be used as-is from the , with the following exceptions: 
 
Jhorgun’taal Athleticism. You bask in the strength that your mixed heritage has bestowed upon you and take to physical activity with ease. You gain proficiency in the Athletics skill. This trait replaces the Menacing trait of the base half-orc traits. Relentless Endurance. It is suggested that half-orcs regain the use of this trait when they finish a short or long rest, rather than only when they finish a long rest. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Goblin, and Orc. 
 
Besides these variants, the Mark of Finding variant race (Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron, pg. 97) can represent both dragonmarked half-orcs and humans of House Tharashk. 

Halflings have survived in the Talenta Plains for thousands upon thousands of years as a nomadic people. Within the last millennium, however, many have integrated into the culture of greater Khorvaire. Subraces. Lightfoot and Stout halflings from page 28 of the represent halflings who have moved away from their tribal roots. While such halflings might be found on the Talenta Plains in small numbers, they are the ones looking to progress society there to be closer to the Five Nations. It is often from these halflings, and those living in the former kingdoms of Galifar, that the Mark of Healing and the Mark of Hospitality manifest. (Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron, pg. 99 and pg. 100 respectively.) Traditional Talenta Halflings, those determined to maintain the ancient ways of their people, use the subrace traits detailed below. 
The Talenta Plains has been the homeland of the halflings for as far back as anyone can record. These small, hardy folk have stood up to ancient empires and yet continue to live humble lives as nomads. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1. Alignment. Halflings of the Talenta Plains tend toward lawful good. They are typically good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways. Talenta Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the boomerang, sharrash, and tangat (detailed in Chapter 4: Equipment). Bonded Mount. Talenta halflings consider the bond between rider and mount to be sacred. After spending 7 days with a beast mount, you may craft a mask to bond with it. While wearing this mask, you may communicate with your bonded mount as if under the effects of the speak with animals spell. In addition, whenever you make a Wisdom or Charisma check involving the mount, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. If your mount is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life, so long as your mask is intact. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your mount’s spirit from the mask and use the bond’s magic to create a new body for it. You 
can return a bonded mount to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body. You may have only one bonded mount at a time, and the bond lasts as long as the mask remains intact. If you attempt to craft a new mask while your original mask still exists, a new bond does not form. Talenta halflings typically favor dinosaurs as mounts, especially the fastieth and carver (Korranberg Chronicle: Threat Dispatch, pg. 3. and pg. 4 respectively) and the clawfoot (Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron, pg. 81).

Humans migrated to Khorvaire in two major waves and have been in that land for several thousand years. They are largely responsible for the cultural development of its nations. The Kingdom of Galifar was a realm united in progress and prosperity, until the Last War set the Five Nations against each other. The Last War may have ended two years ago, but not without a cost. The nation of Cyre, the Jewel of Galifar and rightful successor to the crown, was wiped out on the Day of Mourning. The people of the Five Nations are still in shock over this catastrophe. But even in the face of this unprecedented disaster and the death of their thousand-year kingdom, humanity's ambition cannot be broken. Throughout history, humanity has been there. Inexplicably they have not only survived, or even just thrived, but dominated in a world populated by all manner of races and beasts with innate abilities and talents. Variant Traits. The Campaign Setting includes no less than seven variations on human racial traits. The following dragonmarks all appear on humans and can be found in the Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron on the indicated page numbers: Mark of Finding…… pg. 97 Mark of Handling… pg. 98 Mark of Making …… pg. 101 Mark of Passage ….. pg. 102 Mark of Sentinel ….. pg. 104 For humans that have not manifested a dragonmark, the human traits found on page 31 of the may suffice, or if the campaign uses optional feat rules, the variant human traits found on the same page may be allowed. However, for those looking to spice up a nondragonmarked human, whether optional feat rules are in use or not, there is yet another type of human one can play; one that captures the essence of a pulp action hero or determined noir protagonist. While humans as a whole cannot claim to be the strongest, or toughest, or the most magically adept, some few among them possess an ephemeral quality that sets them apart: paragons of humanity that rise to prominence and lead the way for their fellows. 
Though most non-dragonmarked humans are hard to define as a whole, you are set apart from your fellows by an inexorable determination and a will to etch your name in the history books. You have the following traits. Ability Score Increase. One of ability score of your choice increases by 2 and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1. Age. Paragons mature at the same rate as other humans, though some have jump-started their adventures a year or two earlier than normal. Though their natural lifespans are just about as long as the rest of their kind, paragons tend to either die young in a blaze of glory or remain hearty and hale well after other humans of similar age would have grown infirm. Alignment. Paragons tend to hold extreme beliefs and are rarely neutral, unless they hold "balance" as a strong philosophical ideal. Size. Paragons typically ranged toward the high end of potential human height, some even reaching over 7 feet in height (though the stature of some legendary figures are often exaggerated after their deaths). Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Capable. You gain proficiency in one tool of your choice. Skilled. You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice. Driven. You gain advantage on any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. You must decide to use this ability before you attempt the roll, save, or check. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before you may do so again. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and two extra languages of your choice. 
 
While choosing to play a Paragon Human locks you out of the ability to play a dragonmarked character from 1st level, Paragons that are members of a dragonmarked bloodline are typically the most likely to dramatically and spontaneously develop a Siberys dragonmark later in life. 

Originally descended from the interbreeding of humans and lycanthropes, shifters (otherwise known as "the weretouched") have evolved into a true breeding race with its own cultural identity and traditions. Though not capable of completely changing forms as their ancestors did, shifters are capable of taking on highly animalistic aspects—a state they call shifting. Since most shifters lead a rugged, self-reliant lifestyle, the jump to adventuring is not a big step. Many shifters begin adventuring when some event intrudes on their normal routines, such as an invading monster, or a guide job gone wrong. Subraces. Shifter racial traits can be found on page 65 the Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron, and four subraces representing various shifting aspects are detailed on the following page. Below are several additional shifting aspects that you can select your shifter subrace from. 
Your cliffwalk aspect grants you the ability to ascend steep surfaces with agility. Common bestial traits for shifters with this aspect include small but sharp claws on the hands, and the morphing of feet into canine or feline paws. Many cliffwalk shifters may display ratlike qualities when shifting instead, including long furless tails. Cliffwalk shifters often prefer not to wear shoes, boots, or other apparel on their feet, as their rapidly changing bone structure when shifting often cannot accommodate footwear made for humanoids. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity and Constitution scores increase by 1. Climbing Prowess. Cliffwalk shifters have small claws on their hands and feet that are unsuitable for making attacks but are perfect for climbing. You have a base climbing speed of 20 feet. Shifting Feature. Your shift lasts for 5 minutes instead of 1 minute. While shifted, your climbing speed increases by 20 feet. Additionally, while shifting you may choose to use your Dexterity score to determine your maximum jump distance and you may make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to make difficult jumps instead of a Strength (Athletics) check. Finally, while shifting you are considered to have a running start when making a jump, even if you have not moved any distance prior to the jump on your turn. 
Your dreamsight blood grants you a deeper connection to the natural world around you. Dreamsight shifters do not seem to trend toward any specific bestial appearances but are often born as albinos and have pale coloration even when not shifted. When they do shift, in addition to a more bestial appearance, their eyes take on an eerie glow. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2. Shifting Feature. While shifted, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts, and you add your proficiency bonus on ability checks using the Perception, Insight, and Animal Handling skills. If you are proficient with any of these skills even when not shifting, you add double your proficiency bonus to such checks while shifting, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. 
As a razorclaw shifter, you make swift, slashing strikes in battle. The most common bestial trait for these shifters is, of course, razor-sharp claws, but they will often display secondary characteristics of their bestial appearance as well, such as slit pupils, or patterned fur. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity and Constitution scores increases by 1. Prowl. You have proficiency with the Stealth skill. Shifting Feature. While shifted, your hands become claws that you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you make an unarmed strike using your claws, you may choose to use Dexterity for the attack roll instead of Strength, and if you hit you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. For the duration of your shift, you may make one unarmed strike using a claw as a bonus action. 

Swiftwing shifters often come across impatient and distracted, always eager to be somewhere else while their feet are on the ground. When shifting, the arms of a swiftwing shifter significantly change to allow them the power of flight, usually displaying the ebony plumage of ravens, or the leathery membranes of bat wings. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2 and your Dexterity score increases by 1. Flighty. You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. Additionally, on the turn in which you shift, you also gain the benefit of the Disengage action when you use your bonus action to shift. Shifting Feature. Your shift lasts for 5 minutes instead of 1 minute. While shifted, your arms become wings and you gain a flying speed of 50 feet. While flying this way, you cannot use your arms or hands for any other purpose, such as making attacks, effectively wielding a shield, or casting spells. You may still grasp objects or weapons in your hands but may not use them while you use your shifted arms to fly. 
Truedive shifters are patient and quiet, though not necessarily antisocial. Traits prominent to crocodiles and sharks are the most commonly seen on truedive shifters while they are shifting. Unlike most aspects, truedive shifters are recognizably different from other shifters even when not shifting, displaying little in the way of body hair and having pale skin with a faint aquatic hue to it such as pale blue or green. Some even have unnervingly cold, black eyes. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Amphibious Swimmer. You have a base swimming speed of 20 feet and you can breathe both air and water. Shifting Feature. Your shift lasts for 5 minutes instead of 1 minute. While shifted, your swimming speed increases by 20 feet. Additionally, while shifting you can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations in the water, out to a radius of 120 feet, provided both you and the source of the vibrations are touching the same body of water. Most creatures swimming or wadding through water cause these vibrations, and you are not considered blinded against them while shifted, even if they are invisible to you. 
Winterhide shifters are acclimated to harsh, cold environments. Bestial traits common to arctic predators are common among winterhide shifters, such as thick white fur and hair, but sometimes they can display the same aquatic traits as a truedive shifter, with bodies adapted to the dark chill of the depths. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2. Tundra Acclimation. You are naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the , and you ignore difficult terrain due to natural snow or icy conditions. Additionally, you may shift as a reaction to taking cold damage, gaining the benefits of your shifting feature against the effect that dealt cold damage to you. Shifting Feature. While shifted, you gain resistance to cold damage. 

Though the most common bugbears the people of Khorvaire encounter today are of the savage Marguul tribes (represented by the standard Monster Manual bugbear), the bugbears of ancient Dhakaan are returning. Called the "guul'dar" (meaning "strong people" in the goblin tongue), these Dhakaani bugbears are literally bread for war. In ancient times, they were the shock troops of the empire, and often the first to see action in any military assault. When the empire began to crumble, some clans saw the end was coming, and secluded themselves in deep caves in order to wait out the savage times they saw ahead. Now with the rise of Darguun, a new nation of goblinoids, the Dhakaani clans have resurfaced from history, and people across Khorvaire may once more have a chance to see the guul'dar in action. Variant Statistics. While the savage Marguul bugbears can be represented by the bugbear racial traits on page 119 of Volo’s Guide to Monsters, the below traits represent the bugbears of the emerging Dhakaani clans. 
As a bugbear raised in the hidden Dhakaani clanholds, you have traits in common with your other bugbears that follow the same ancient traditions. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Bugbears reach adulthood after roughly a decade and a half and live about eighty years. Size. Bugbears are the largest of the goblinoids, standing on average 7 feet in height, but some reaching as tall as 8 feet. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Goblinoid. You belong to one of the three major goblinoid races. Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Long-Limbed. When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal. Dhakaani Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the flail, plus the mighty flail, dire flail, and spiked chain (detailed in Chapter 4: Equipment) Keen Smell. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on smell. Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

Often confused for more intimidating, well-equipped lizardfolk, the draconic nature of the dragonborn is overlooked by the settlers of New Galifar, leading to them being colloquially known as "scales" just like the reptilian humanoids they share that jungle with. Little do the settlers know that the dragonborn once ruled a great empire that challenged the might of the Dhakaani goblinoids. Those sages who do know of this ancient empire are often perplexed by its seemingly swift collapse for no discernible reason. For their part, dragonborn refuse to say much more about this fall besides "it was a matter of honor". Most dragonborn today are honor-bound to defend ancient ruins deep in the jungles of Q'barra, but the race is prone to a fierce sense of pride. Dragonborn adventurers roam far from their jungle homes to seek personal glory. Others might be honor-bound on some quest that will aid their clan in their ancestral duty. Racial Traits. Dragonborn racial traits can be found on page 34 of the , with one alteration: Alignment. Dragonborn society revolves around honor, duty, and loyalty to the clan. Dragonborn are likely to either embrace or reject this completely and are rarely neutral on the law/chaos axis of their alignments. The method by which you carry out your duty matters less than the fact that you do it, so the good/evil alignment is less extreme.

Unlike in other campaign settings, the drow of Eberron are considered a separate race from elves entirely and are not a monolithic culture. Likewise, their origins do not lie with a tale of betrayal between elven gods (Lolth and Corellon are not included in the Eberron campaign setting by default). Drow, instead are an engineered race, created from the arcane manipulation of elves by the ancient giants of Xen’drik. Racial Traits. Below, the drow are detailed as their own race, replacing the elven drow subrace in the . Additionally, three distinct drow subraces are presented, each of which born from a unique culture. 
All drow, regardless of culture, share some traits in common. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. Drow mature physically at about the same rate that humans do, and can live just as long as elves, about seven-and-a-half centuries. However, different drow cultures have different standards for adulthood. Size. Drow have the same slender build as elves, ranging from under 5 to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. Sunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. Trance. Drow don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. (If you are using the Trance and Dreams variant for elves, the same variant applies to drow as well). Drow Cultures. Long ago, at the end of the Age of Giants, the drow people fractured and their cultures diverged greatly in the roll of millennium since. Choose one of the options below. 
The most frequently encountered kind of drow in Eberron are the Vulkori tribal drow living in the jungles of Xen'drik. Most of these tribes worship the scorpion-god known as Vulkoor. Khorvarian sages consider Vulkoor an animal-totem version of The Mockery, a god of the Dark Six. While many scorpion tribes worship Vulkoor exclusively and are viciously xenophobic, other tribes known as Qaltair worship analogues of the rest of the Sovereign Host and Dark Six and are willing to deal peacefully with outsiders in a limited fashion. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2. Alignment. The scorpion tribes live in ruthless, deadly jungles and have a temperament to match. Most tend toward evil alignments, and while the Qaltair are less likely to be so, it is difficult for foreigners to discern which tribe one of these drow belongs to at first glance. In either case, the loose structure of their savage way of life highlights their chaotic nature. Age. Though the savage drow of the scorpion tribes can ostensibly live just as long as other elves and drow, it is far more likely for them to meet a swift and grisly end in the wild jungles of Xen’drik. Therefore, scorpion tribe drow are considered to be adults as soon as they become physically capable of raising the next generation of their tribe. Fleet of Foot. Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet. Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Mask of the Wild. You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena. Tribal Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the shortsword, plus the Xen'drik boomerang and spiked chain (which you refer to as a "scorpion chain") detailed in Chapter 4: Equipment. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and Giant. Common is not a native language of the scorpion tribes, but the Qaltair learn it in order to facilitate commerce with residents of Stormreach. Depending on how long your tribe has lived near and interacted with Stormreach, you may or may not speak Common with a noticeable accent. 

The Sulatar clans (or "firebinders" in the Giant language) remained loyal to their fire giant masters during the elven rebellions. They retain the secrets of elemental binding their masters taught them and make frequent use of flaming weapons and fire elementals. The firebinders consider the drow of the scorpion tribes to be savages and traitors, and the tribal drow hate the Sulatar for their continuing loyalty to their cruel slave-masters. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Alignment. The fire giants were harsh, cruel taskmasters to the Sulatar, and they were apt pupils in this regard. Sulatar tend toward law and evil. Age. Living behind the ruins of their master’s fortresses, the Sulatar are more defended against the wild predations of Xen’drik as their estranged tribal brethren. As such, their society can dictate that one is not truly an adult until they have learned the art of elemental binding, something they consider an impossibility to truly understand without at least a century of practice and mastery. Arcane Education. Sulatar are well versed in the affect planes have on the material plane and their interaction with arcane forces. You have proficiency in the Arcana skill. Flame Binding. All adult Sulatar drow know the basics of binding the essence of Fernia, the Sea of Fire, to their will. You know the control flame cantrip (Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 152). Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the burning hands spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the scorching ray spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Sulatar Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the scimitar, shortsword, and whip, plus the twobladed sword (detailed in Chapter 4: Equipment). A Sulatar-made shortsword, and both ends of their twobladed swords, appear much like a Roman gladius. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Elvish, Giant, and the Ignan dialect of Primordial. 

When dragonfire rained down on all that the giants held dear, the progenitors of the Umbragen fled into the depths of Khyber. In their wanderings, the Umbragen uncovered ancient lore that led them to a mystical force of darkness called the Umbra. They bound this shadowy essence to their flesh and survived by calling upon it for generation after generation. Thousands of years later, the Umbragen have begun to surface. Some say they are seeking refuge from an unfathomable threat rising from the twisting depths of Khyber. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1. Alignment. The Umbragen worship a dispassionate force of darkness. While it is not evil, they have stoically forfeited their souls to dark oblivion in its depths. Many centuries of fighting against their unfathomable enemy has forced them to maintain a lawful, disciplined society. Age. The Umbragen may have at one time had the luxury of waiting for their young to live a century before considering them adults, just as elves do now. However, their current desperate struggle has forced them to consider as an adult any able-bodied drow that can fight and defend their underground cities from annihilation, usually before they have reached twenty years of age. 
Superior Darkvision. Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet. Unlike other drow, Umbragen eyes are completely black, a visible sign of this enhanced vision and their link to the Umbra. Shadow Steps. You have proficiency with the Stealth skill. Soul of Darkness. By virtue of your birth into the Umbragen, your soul has been pledged to oblivion within the Umbra. Any spell that brings its target back to life (such as revivify or raise dead) must be cast from a spell slot one level higher than normal in order to function on you. Otherwise, the spell fails as if counterspelled. In addition, you can cast the darkness spell once using this trait. When you reach 7th level, you may cast deeper darkness using this trait instead of darkness. You regain the ability to cast either spell using this trait when you finish a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Finally, you can see through any magical darkness you or another Umbragen creates by using this trait. Umbragen Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the rapier, shortsword, and hand crossbow. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Daelkyr, Elvish, and Undercommon. 
 
In ancient times, after the fall of giant civilization, a small population of debased giantkind fled Xen'drik, fleeing from an existential threat. During their flight across the Thunder Sea, an enormous tempest rose up and smashed into their fleet. When the skies cleared, they found themselves stranded in the open waters with half their fleet missing and no idea of their heading or course. They sailed aimlessly for months until their supplied nearly ran out before finally landing on the continent of Sarlona. There, they continued their ancient ways of wandering and became nomads in a new, less hostile land. Centuries later, the ogre kingdom of Borunan was eradicated during the last days of the Sundering, when the Inspired lords forged the Riedran Empire and united the humans of Sarlona against them. The surviving ogres fled into the wild region of Syrkarn, where they were taken in by the nomadic giant folk that now called that untamed wilderness of Sarlona their home. The eneko are the true-breeding halfbreeds of these two peoples. While a fairly regular sight on the continent of Sarlona, the eneko are nearly completely unknown to the peoples of Khorvaire and would be confused for normal ogres on sight. 
Racial Traits. Eneko have a slight green tint to their skin that engenders the belief that they descended not only from Borunan's ogres, but the near-mythical oni as well. Their innate magical talents lend credence to this belief. 
Eneko see themselves as the hearty intermixing of the best traits of all their ancestors, a "mongrel" folk made stronger for the amalgamation of many peoples. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1. Age. Eneko mature to adulthood at around age 30, though many might strike out on their own before that. They can live for about a century and a half. Size. Eneko are shorter than other kinds of halfogres, roughly 6-and-a-half to 7 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Eneko Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. Eneko Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the longbow. Giant Endurance. Whenever you make saving throw to resist environmental effects due to weather or climate, you are considered proficient in the saving throw and add double your proficiency bonus to the saving throw, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. Oni Magic. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the pass without trace spell once with this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it. Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Riedran and Giant.


 In ancient times, the gnolls of Eberron were savage, demon-worshipping monsters that believed the blessing of some demonic god flowed through their veins. With the founding of the Znir Pact, the gnolls forsook the hideous rituals and depravity of their ancestors. Znir Pact gnolls worship no demons or gods, and instead have a practice of raising piles of rubble to represent the idolatrous objects of worship that the Znir Pact founders shattered when they threw off the influence of their demonic Overlord. Today, the Znir Pact functions as a neutral policing force in Droaam, entrusted by the Daughters of Sora Kell to maintain peace amongst their warlords' territories. In past centuries of united Galifar, when the territory of Droaam was once western Breland, the Znir Pact were counted among the citizens of Breland. In fact, there was a long history of Brelish royalty hiring bodyguards of Znir Pact gnolls, for their reputation as skilled mercenaries were highly sought after. Gnolls of the Znir Pact might become adventurers as a way to gather information for the Daughters of Sora Kell, essentially being government agents on scouting missions. Znir Pact gnolls also often sign up as mercenaries with House Tharashk and House Deneith. Others might simply wish to see more of the world, like any civilized person struck by wanderlust. Racial Traits. The following racial traits can be used to play a gnoll of the Znir Pact in Eberron campaigns. 
You share a number of traits with other gnolls of the Znir Pact. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2 and your Dexterity score increases by 1. Alignment. The Znir Pact is a highly rigid philosophy of discipline and balance, leading gnolls raised in such a culture to usually be lawful and neutral aligned. Age. Gnolls reach maturity within a decade, and rarely live longer than three. Size. Gnolls resemble bipedal, human-sized hyenas. They have a hunched posture and stand close to 7 feet tall but are lean. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Keen Smell. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on smell. Fleet of Foot. Your base walking speed is 35 feet. Disciplined Defiance. You have advantage on all saving throws against being charmed or frightened. Znir Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the longbow, quarterstaff, and shortsword. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Goblin, and Gnoll. 

In ancient times, after the fall of giant civilization, a collection of several tribes of debased giantkind roamed the peaks of the northern mountain ranges of Xen'drik, in what is now called the Skyfall Peninsula just north of the ruins that would one day be the foundation of Stormreach. At some point, these tribes undertook a mass exodus, seeking to flee the "Hungry Shadows", seeming ghosts from the lowland jungles that hunted them to near extinction. Taking inspiration from legends of another mass exodus in Xen'drik's ancient past, these giantkind descended their mountains, built ships, and sailed northward toward the horizon. After suffering the loss of nearly half their fleet to the tempestuous Thunder Sea, they landed just east of the Shadow Marches in current-day Droaam. From there, they wandered, avoiding civilization as their ancestors had taught them, until they reached the Byeshk Mountains to the north, where they remained. Tribes of these giantkind, called "goliaths" by the native orcs and goblinoids of the lowlands, wandered across the range of the Byeshk Mountains, mining the rare purple ore the mountains take their name from to make crafts, jewelry, and weapons. They acclimated to their new mountains and led a nomadic, mostly peaceful life there for several millennia, until the Xoriat invasion. They were enslaved to toil in their own mines by the goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire, when demand of byeshk ore skyrocketed shortly before the empire fell, leaving them once more to their nomadic life. Because of this enslavement, and the horrors of Xoriat that seemed to follow the goblinoids to their mountain homes, the goliaths have a distrust of lowlanders, and kept a mostly isolated existence for almost nine millennia since. Only with the formation of Droaam were they drawn into the dealings of lowlanders, when the Daughters of Sora Kell managed to unite their tribes under one High Chief, who herself bows to the Daughters. Goliaths are a hardy people, taken to almost foolhardy heights of daring as they leap from cliff to cliff. Goliaths usually become adventurers to prove themselves to their tribe, to perform a service for Droaam, or to explore the world outside the Byeshk Mountains, convinced that much has to have changed in the millennia since their enslavement by a nowdead empire. Racial Traits. Goliath racial traits can be found on page 10 of the Elemental Evil Player’s Companion, with one alteration: Languages. Goliaths in Eberron can speak, read, and write Common, Giant, and Goblin. 

The ancient goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan once spanned the length and breadth of Khorvaire. The hobgoblins ruled Dhakaan for many centuries and may have continued to the present day if otherworldly forces of insanity and horror had not broken the will of the "dar", the goblinoid people. When the empire began to collapse in the wake of this nightmare war, some clans saw the end was coming, and secluded themselves in deep caves in order to wait out the savage times they saw ahead. Now with the rise of Darguun, the ghaal'dar hobgoblins are determined to conquer Khorvaire once more, and the Dhakaani clans have resurfaced from history to take notice—or more likely, to seize control. Racial Traits. The below hobgoblin racial traits replace those found in Volo’s Guide to Monsters, to more readily present hobgoblin subraces. 
All hobgoblins, regardless of tribe or clan, have some natural traits in common. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age. Hobgoblins reach adulthood shortly after a decade and live about as long as humans. Size. Hobgoblins are roughly the same size as humans, though typically hardier. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Goblinoid. You belong to one of the three major goblinoid species. Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Legacy of Respect. Whenever you make a Charisma check to interact with a goblinoid, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin. Subrace. The Ghaal’dar tribes arose after the fall the ancient goblin empire and the self-enforced exile of the remaining Dhakaani clans. Though many of the Dhakaani clans are alike in their traditions and focus, there are a few unique ones, like the Kech Volaar. Choose one of the options below. 
Without the iron rule of the Dhakaan, the ghaal’dar tribes devolved into centuries of posturing and infighting. It wasn’t until the Last War that the ghaal’dar were united into a nation once again. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 1. Martial Training. You are proficient with two martial weapons of your choice and with light armor. Saving Face. Ghaal’dar Hobgoblins are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 
The Dhakaani respect one thing above all else: military might. Some might mistake hobgoblins as brutes, but the Dhakaani are actually quite sharp, especially when it comes to tactics and strategy. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Tactical Cunning. Hobgoblins soldiers train extensively to fight cooperatively. You may take the Help action to aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you as a bonus action. Dhakaani Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the flail, plus the mighty flail, dire flail, and spiked chain (detailed in Chapter 4: Equipment). 
The Kech Volaar, or "Wordbearers" are an ancient Dhakaani clan of hobgoblins only recently resurfacing with the formation of Darguun. Their entire lineage is devoted to preserving goblinoid history through text and song. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2. Keeper of Stories. The Wordbearers have long known the importance of remembering the past. Your Legacy of Respect trait also allows you to double your proficiency bonus on Intelligence (History) checks related to the history of the goblinoid races.

You have proficiency with the Performance skill, Calligrapher's supplies, and one Musical Instrument of your choice. Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.

Minotaurs are a common sight in the monstrous nation of Droaam, where the Daughters of Sora Kell have granted them a territory to claim as their own. Lead by their warlord Rhesh Turakbar in the worship of the Horned Prince, minotaurs are mainly viewed by the people of Khorvaire as bloodthirsty savages. Minotaurs view the Horned Prince as their overlord and creator, but each individual minotaur has his own view on who or what the Horned Prince is and finds all other opinions inherently flawed. During the Last War, House Tharashk negotiated with the Daughters of Sora Kell to contract the monstrous inhabitants of the nation as mercenaries. Today, minotaurs can be seen accompanying Tharashk heirs on prospecting missions and as intimidating bodyguards to those who can afford them. Exposure to more civilized and metropolitan views have influenced these minotaurs. These days, it is not uncommon to find minotaurs outside Droaam that identify the Horned Prince with the Dol Dorn, the Sovereign of Strength and War, or Balinor, the Sovereign of Beasts and the Hunt, rather than some darker entity. Racial Traits. The following racial traits can be used to play a minotaur in Eberron campaigns. 
 
Regardless of their outlook, Minotaurs share common traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2. Many Paths. Every minotaur reaches the Horned Prince by his or her own personal path. Your choice of your Constitution, Intelligence, or Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Minotaurs enter adulthood at around the age of 17 and can live up to 150 years. Alignment. Minotaurs vary widely in their beliefs, just like any intelligent humanoid, but have had a narrow cultural experience for centuries under the rule of demon-worshipping leaders like Rhesh Turakbar. This has caused them to lean toward evil alignments, but exposure to other cultures can downplay this influence. Size. Minotaurs typically stand well over 7 feet tall and weigh a hulking average of 450 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Horns. Your horns are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with an unarmed strike using your horns, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Goring Rush. Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least as far as your speed, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action. Hammering Horns. Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to shove that creature with your horns using your reaction. The creature must be no more than one size larger than you and within 5 feet of you. It must make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. If it fails, you push it up to 5 feet away from you. Menacing. You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill. Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc.

Orcs are one of the indigenous races of Khorvaire, having spread across the continent since well before the formation of the goblinoid Dhakaani Empire in the Age of Monsters. They are a fiercely passionate people and well-disposed to throwing themselves blindly into a cause without overthinking it. Because of this tendency to act on impulse and "gut feeling" over logic and reason, orcs have never formed a large civilization over the countless untold millennia they have existed. When human settlers from Sarlona landed on western Khorvaire in the Demon Wastes and the Shadow Marches, the native orc tribes at first warred with them. But over time, these people mingled, and many orcs eagerly embraced the new gods the humans brought with them, the Sovereign Host. Many orcs even counted their legendary racial folk hero, the oneeyed Garu-Umesh as an aspect of Balinor, Sovereign of the Hunt. But older, more primal faiths still hold sway, especially in the Shadow Marches, where descendants of the original orc druid Gatekeepers and the Cults of the Dragon Below continue to clash. Variant Statistics. While the orc racial traits on page 120 of Volo’s Guide to Monsters might be a decent fit for the bloodthirsty brutes of other settings, the below variant racial traits more accurately represent the more varied orcs of Eberron. 
In Eberron, orcs are not the universally evil creatures they are in other settings. Mostly they are a hardy, tough people acclimated to harsh environments, and very emotional about their beliefs. However, some isolated tribes of orcs, such as the Jhorash'tar of the Mror Holds lowlands and the Ghaash'kala of the Demon Wastes, lead a much more savage existence, and are culturally predisposed toward aggression and cowing those weaker than them. When playing an orc from such a remote tribe, you may replace the Survivor trait of the base orc traits with the following trait: Menacing. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. 
Your orc character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age. Orcs mature faster than humans, standing fully grown and developed at around age 12. Their lives are significantly shorter than a human’s, however, with those living past 50 years being a rarity. Alignment. Orcs tend to be passionate, with little regard for extensive rules and obligations, and tend toward chaotic alignments. Contrary to some vile prejudices, orcs do not tend toward evil alignments. Size. Orcs usually stand over 6 feet tall and are typically much more muscular and burly than a human of the same height, weighing between 230 and 280 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of grey. Passionate. Orcs are defined by their strong emotions, often heedless of danger while trusting their convictions. You may roll a d8 and add it to the result of any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check that hasn't already benefited from a Bardic Inspiration die. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to roll this d8, but you must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. When you reach 3rd level, you may choose to add the result of this d8 to a weapon damage roll. You can use this feature once and regain the ability to do so after finishing a short or long rest. Savage Attacks. When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit. Survivor. Orcs can thrive in the harshest of environments. You gain proficiency with the Survival skill. Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Goblin, and Orc

The sahuagin of the Thunder Sea are aquatic humanoids with strong piscine features, including large mouths filled with sharp, shark-like teeth. They often interact with coastal settlements along the southern shores of Khorvaire, and the port city of Stormreach on Xen'drik's coast. Though they are said to worship the Devourer of the Dark Six, known to them as Shargon, they have several peaceful treaties with nations and even House Lyrandar. Sahuagin often act as guides for sailing vessels and House Lyrandar wind galleons as they make their way across the surface of the Thunder Sea, typically sailing to and from the city of Stormreach. Although sahuagin can breathe air for a short time, they are ultimately dependent on saltwater to live. Due to this, most sahuagin adventurers limit themselves to underwater questing, or stick close to coastal lands. Experienced sahuagin adventurers that are struck with keen wanderlust and an overwhelming desire to walk dry land indefinitely seek out magic items capable of creating saltwater, such as a variant decanter of endless water, or items that make carrying large quantities of it possible, such as a bag of holding or portable hole. Racial Traits. The following racial traits can be used to play a sahuagin in Eberron campaigns. 
Sahuagin share some natural traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength and Wisdom scores increase by 1. Alignment. As intelligent humanoids, sahuagin alignments run the gamut. Though the dark god Shargon features prominently in their culture, and they have evolved with predatory instincts, they do not inherently tend toward evil. Age. Sahuagin are birthed live, like sharks are, and reach full maturity in under a decade. They typically live for about a century. 
Size. Sahuagin are scaled, fishy humanoids. When on land they stand with a hunched posture that makes them seem slightly smaller than the average human. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed of 40 feet. Superior Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Bite. Your razor-toothed maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Blood Frenzy. If you reduce a creature to half or less of its hit points, you can enter a blood frenzy as a reaction to gain advantage on attack rolls against that creature for 1 minute or until it is reduced to 0 hit points. If you reduce the creature to 0 hit points with a bite attack, you regain the use of this ability, otherwise you must finish a short or long rest to use it again. Limited Amphibiousness. You can breathe air and water, but you need to be submerged in saltwater at least once every 4 hours for no less than 1 minute. For every four hours you go without submerging yourself, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a level of exhaustion. Levels of exhaustion gained this way cannot be removed by any spell or effect. They can only be removed by submerging yourself in saltwater. For every minute submerged, one level of exhaustion gained this way is removed. Shark Telepathy. You can telepathically communicate with any beast that is a shark (giant sharks, hunter sharks, reef sharks, etc.) within 120 feet of you. When communicating with a shark this way, you can innately cast animal friendship on it at will. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast beast bond with this trait, but only on beasts that are sharks. Once you cast it, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Casting these spells in this way requires no components and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Sahuagin. Sahuagin is your native language, and it is most suited to speaking underwater. On the surface, it has a gasping, raw-throated quality that many land dwellers find off-putting. 

Sahuagin who perform a dark rite to Shargon, involving the complete devouring of a land-walking humanoid or aquatic elf, may undergo a transformation into a malenti; a sahuagin that is indistinguishable from an aquatic elf in appearance. You may play as a sahuagin that has completed this ritual or, if your DM allows, you might begin the game as a normal sahuagin, then complete the ritual during the course of play. Whenever your transformation occurs, the below traits replace the Ability Score Increase, Alignment, Size, Bite, Limited Amphibiousness, and Languages traits of the base sahuagin. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Alignment. Because the nature of the ritual to transform a malenti involves the literal devouring of a sentient, living person, it is very common for malenti to be evil. However, the one devoured in the ritual may have been willing, or some other extenuating circumstances may have been involved, that can justify a non-evil malenti. Still, it is a rare sahuagin that is truly altruistic and good that can go through with the ritual. Size. Malenti range in height and build exactly as elves do and appear to all inspection to be aquatic elves. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed of 40 feet. Amphibious. You can breathe air and water. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Sahuagin, and an additional language that was known by the creature you devoured to become a malenti. You speak this extra language with the same fluency and accent that the devoured creature did. 

Originally intended to be mindless machines to fight in the Last War, the warforged developed sentience unintentionally. As House Cannith strove to make them the ultimate tools of war, each successive generation of warforged to emerge from the creation forges saw them become more intuitive and capable of growth, until they became a new kind of creature. Since the Treaty of Thronehold, the warforged have been recognized as living creatures, setting them free. For many warforged, this freedom merely confuses them. Born to be soldiers and take orders, many join adventuring parties just to be directed toward the next fight. Other warforged seek a deeper meaning to their existence and become adventurers to find their answers. Variant Statistics. Warforged have been officially updated to 5th edition and their racial traits can be found starting on page 68 of the Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron. However, to strike a balance between the classic warforged feel of previous editions and the extremely mutable warforged presented in the Wayfinder’s Guide, the following traits can be taken in place of the warforged’s Integrated Armor trait: Model Type. You cannot wear armor of any kind. Your body is one of three models that determines your Armor Class but you are not considered to be wearing any sort of armor (though your chosen model type and may impose restrictions that are similar). Regardless of your model type, the AC provided by it increases by +1 when you reach 3rd level, and another +1 when you reach 5th level. Choose one type of model below: Composite Plating. Your basic composite body grants you an Armor Class of 14 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum +2). You have disadvantage on Stealth checks. You cannot cast spells unless you are proficient with medium armor Mithral Tracery. Your mithral-lined body grants you an Armor Class of 11 + your Dexterity modifier. Adamantine Construction. Your body grants you an Armor Class of 17. You have disadvantage on Stealth checks. You cannot cast spells unless you are proficient with heavy armor. Remodeling. It is possible to change your model type with extensive modifications. You or another proficient with Arcana and either artificer's tools, carpenter's tools, jeweler's tools, mason's tools, smith's tools, or tinker's tools can work for 8 hours a day for 1 workweek and consume 500 gold pieces worth of raw materials. At the end of this period, you may change your model type. 
 
Some players and DM may question how similar warforged are to normal humanoids. Do warforged bleed? Do they heal naturally? Do they benefit from healing spells that indicate they don’t work on constructs? Those wishing to play with warforged that are significantly different from other races may use the following additional racial traits: Living Construct. You are both a constructed being and a living creature. You have two creature types: construct and humanoid. You can be affected by a spell or ability if it works on either of your creature types. Because of this, you can be healed by spells that specify they don't work on constructs; however, you regain only half the amount of hit points restored by non-transmutation spells that restore hit points and from potions of healing (all types). Other effects that restore hit points function as normal. Required Maintenance. Warforged do not heal naturally over time. In order for you to regain hit points and Hit Dice after a long rest, you or an ally at hand must cast the mending cantrip on you, or alternatively spend two hours during the long rest repairing your body. To do so, you or your ally must possess and be proficient with at least one of the following types of artisan's tools: artificer's tools, carpenter's tools, jeweler's tools, mason's tools, smith's tools, or tinker's tools. If your class or background would supply you with armor as equipment, you may take one of these tools or a shield in its place. If you cannot maintain yourself in this way, you do not restore your hit points to maximum or regain Hit Dice, but you receive all other benefits of a long rest. Inert State. The alchemical fluid flowing through your circulatory system clots quicker than blood when exposed to air. When you are at 0 hit points, it only takes you 2 successful death saving throws to become stable, but you do not regain 1 hit point after 1d4 hours. Instead, you remain stable and unconscious indefinitely, until healed or damaged. You still die at 3 failed death saving throws. Additionally, the spare the dying cantrip has no effect on you. 

 Most aasimar would have you believe that their kind are descended from the blessed union of a mortal and a celestial being of light and goodness. Sometimes it's true. However, the most frequently occurring aasimar bloodlines are the result of cults centered around fallen angels, cast down to the mortal world where their perverse ideas of divinity will run their course. Subraces. While the Protector, Scourge, and Fallen Aasimar on page 105 of the Volo’s Guide to Monsters may be found in Eberron, the Idolatrous aasimar presented below is the most likely kind of aasimar to be encountered. 
Once-celestial begins known a "Radiant Idols" are cast out of Syrania, the Azure Sky, as punishment for claiming to be gods and obsessively embodying a divine domain. While Radiant Idols could twist even benevolent forces like Life into something foul and malign, many of the fallen embodied the darkest of powers, such as Death and Corruption. As an idolatrous aasimar, you are descended from one of these beings, and the power of their domain flows strongly through your tainted celestial blood. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Beguiling Tongue. Your ancestor was a being with unparalleled ability to manipulate and deceive. A part of this power lingers within you. Choose either Persuasion or Deception. You gain proficiency in the chosen skill. Idolatrous Legacy. When you reach 3rd level, choose any divine domain cleric subclass (including those listed in a later chapter). You gain the ability to use the Channel Divinity feature that domain grants to 2nd level clerics. Your effective cleric level for this ability is equal to your character level, and if the ability can be resisted with a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. You can use this ability once, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. If you are a cleric, the divine domain you choose for this trait need not be the same as the divine domain you selected for your actual cleric subclass. Earthbound. As part of your ancestor's divine punishment, they were barred from ever knowing the joy of flight. While you are not so irrevocably chastised, the power of this sanction still flows through your tainted blood. Any spell that grants flight or otherwise defies gravity (fly, levitate, feather fall, etc.) must be cast from a spell slot one level higher than usual to affect you, otherwise it fails. In addition, any magical item that grants the ability to fly counts as two items for the purposes of your magic item attunement limit.  
 
 Though not truly descended from the abominable daelkyr, the so-called "half-blood" progeny of those horrific and alien fiends could not exist without them. The daelkyr are bound to Khyber, unable to reach the surface of Eberron, but the malignant influence of their power can still seep into the world above, where the ancient seals keeping them in place begin to fail. Unfortunately, the unborn are most vulnerable to this seepage. These innocents, growing in their mother's wombs, become tainted, and are born as daelkyr halfbloods... and all are born with an even more aberrant twin. Most daelkyr half-bloods become adventurers to flee sentiments of distrust and disgust, even from their own parents. Shunned because of their bond with their hideous siblings, they take to the roads to search for adventure and discovery, and to forget their troubles. 
Your daelkyr half-blood has the below traits due to the taint of Xoriat Ability Score Increase. Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1. Age. Daelkyr half-bloods mature at the same rate as humans but do not generally live as long, since they are more likely to suffer from degenerative health conditions in the twilight of their lives. Alignment. Daelkyr half-bloods must always fight vile thoughts that may or may not be their own. They tend toward evil, and are usually neutral at best, but it is not impossible for an exceptional individual to find comfort in altruism and become good. In any case, their roiling madness almost always tends toward chaotic alignments. Size. Daelkyr half-bloods are built much like humans but appear a little sickly. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Aberrant. Your body might appear to be humanoid, but something about your presence is anathema. Beasts that are indifferent to you become agitated and hostile if they are within 30 feet of you for more than a minute, even if you are not visible. All attempts to calm them once they are hostile have disadvantage while you are in sight of them. You also have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to influence a humanoid if you are not proficient in the Persuasion skill. Personal Symbiont. You begin play with one personal symbiont that you can pick from the following list: breed leech, crawling gauntlet, or throwing scarab. While attuned to your person 
symbiont, it does not count toward your limit of attuned magic items. At 5th level, you can choose to mutate your personal symbiont into a different form from those previously available to you, or into a form from the following list: stormstalk, or winter cyst. If you do, your personal symbiont cannot revert to its previous form until 10th level. At 10th level, your symbiont may mutate again into any form previously available, plus the following: spellwurm, tentacle whip. At 15th level, your symbiont may mutate again into any form previously available, plus the following: shadow sibling, tongue worm. At 20th level, your symbiont may mutate again into any form previously available, or into a living breastplate. If you do, your personal symbiont cannot revert to its previous form. If a personal symbiont is lost or killed, you can grow a replacement from your own flesh over a period of 1d4 days. When you begin to regrow a replacement, you can choose a different form currently available to you (as above). You can’t grow or regrow symbionts that you have gained in any other manner, nor can you grow a replacement for a personal symbiont if the original personal symbiont still lives. Symbiont Dependency. Without daily contact with at least one symbiont, you begin to wither away. For every 24 hours you have no contact with a symbiont, your hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If your hit point maximum is reduced to 0 this way, you die. This reduction to your maximum hit points cannot be prevented or restored by any means, not even with a greater restoration spell, until you attach a symbiont. Symbiont Mastery. You do not suffer any negative effect from attaching, removing, or benefiting from the abilities of symbionts. Unbalanced Mind. Your mind is in constant selfrevolt and contact with it can be debilitating. Any creature that attempts to read your thoughts, study your mind, or make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine information about you suffers disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saves for 1 round. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice. 
 
The statistics for the symbionts available to daelkyr half-bloods can be found starting on page 23 of The Korranberg Chronicle: Threat Dispatch, a Pay-WhatYou-Want title on the DMsGuild. 

Born from both the living and the undead, dhampyr in Eberron can be seen as either an abomination or a blessing. The first dhampyr in existence were created purposely by the Qabalrin elves eons ago, as part of experiments with infusing negative energy into mortal flesh. The practice of copulating with vampires continued with the traditions of the line of Vol, until the purging of the bloodline and the exiling of their allies from the Isle of Aerenal. In modern times, most dhampyr are the progeny of a human and a vampire, rather than elven and vampiric parents, but dhampyr created from any common race and a vampire is possible. The faith of the Blood of Vol looks upon the undead as martyrs of their faith, making the rare dhampyr birth a holy occurrence. But the faithful of other religions still hold to the belief that vampires are evil, unnatural, and predatory creatures, causing most common folk to look upon dhampyr with distrust and suspicion. Even in Karrnath, where belief in the Blood of Vol is more common, dhampyr can often make people uneasy, with either awe or fear. 
As a dhampyr, your character has the below traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 2. Age. Dhampyr age at the same rate as humans until they reach adulthood, then live indefinitely unless they die to accident, disease, violence, or blood thirst (see below). Alignment. The individual personality and alignment of a dhampyr depends on how he or she reacts to the attitudes of others toward the undead. A dhampyr might loathe the undead and take up arms against his cursed heritage, or they might embrace their vampiric origins and enjoy lording over others. 
Size. Dhampyr can be either Medium or Small, depending on which race their mortal parent was. Speed. Regardless of your size, your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Vampiric Progeny. Although you are a living creature, the energy of Mabar suffuses your body. When you are the target of a non-necromancy spell that would normally cause its target to regain hit points, you do not regain any hit points and instead suffer radiant damage equal to the amount of hit points the spell would normally cause its target to regain.   Likewise, when you would normally be dealt necrotic damage, you do not take any necrotic damage from the attack or effect that dealt it and instead regain a number of hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage the attack or effect would normally deal. Captivating. You inherit some of the dark charm of your vampiric parent. You have proficiency with the Persuasion skill. Blood Thirst. You can drain blood and life energy from a willing creature, or one that is grappled by you, incapacitated, or restrained. As an action, make a melee attack against the target with proficiency. If you hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The necrotic damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). For every three days you do not successfully deal 1 or more points of necrotic damage with this attack, you suffer one level of exhaustion. Levels of exhaustion gained this way cannot be removed by rest or magic; they can only be removed by dealing necrotic damage with this attack. Doing so instantly removes one level of exhaustion gained this way for every point of necrotic damage it deals (but not levels of exhaustion gained by any other means). Sunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one additional language of your choice. 

Eladrin are almost unheard of in modern-day Khorvaire. Their society has hidden behind powerful illusory veils and the shifting of realities for millennia. In ancient history however, one of their veiled cities was discovered, ransacked, and destroyed by the ancient giants of Xen'drik. The fallen Feyspire’s people were taken and experimented on to create elves and drow, who lost most of their cultural heritage under giant enslavement. However, since the Day of Mourning the eladrin’s veils have failed. The Feyspires have now become stuck in the fabric of the cosmos, them and their people anchored to the material plane. Eladrin might become adventurers to solve the mystery of the cosmically-stuck Feyspires, or to explore the current society they are now stranded in. They often attempt to pass themselves off as elves, as they bear a striking resemblance to them, with the exception of their solid-color eyes. Racial Traits. Below, the eladrin are detailed as their own race, replacing the elven eladrin subrace in the Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes. Additionally, two distinct eladrin subraces are presented, each of which representing a facet of life for the fey people of Thelanis. 
All eladrin regardless of their subrace share some natural traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 1. Age. Eladrin have the same rate of maturity and concept of adulthood as elves, but they are fey creatures who do not die of old age. Alignment. As fey beings of Thelanis, the Eladrin are living stories. They each tell a tale with every breath they take and step they make. Depending on where an Eladrin exists within the larger narrative of Thelanis, their alignments can vary dramatically. Size. Eladrin have statuesque, svelte builds, and stand over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Your fey eyes see more than mere mortal vision can. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Fey Blood. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. You are also fey, not humanoid, and spells and effects only detect and affect you as such. 
Fey Step. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Trance. Eladrin don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. (If you are using the Trance and Dreams variant for elves, the same variant applies to drow as well). Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. To the untrained ear, Sylvan sounds nearly identical to Elvish. However, the two languages are separated by tens of thousands of years of development, and Sylvan sounds incredibly archaic to the point of gibberish to elves who do not speak Sylvan. Eladrin Subraces. There are two major cultures of eladrin amongst the planes of Eberron: Feyspire eladrin and wild eladrin. Choose one of these subraces. 
The Feyspires, six glorious citadels of culture, magic, and civilization once stood amongst the beautiful wilderness of Thelanis. Civilization and nature stood in harmony, each made more beautiful by the contrast. Now, the Feyspires have become stuck in the mire of the material plane, and the courtly eladrin within them must deal with the mundane world beyond. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2. Alignment. The story of eladrin born in a Feyspire can be somewhat rigid, as they follow the story of their Lord or Lady. Most Feyspire eladrin match the alignment of their ruler, typically lawful, as they play supporting roles in the tale of their patron, but some may play the part of antagonist or rebel, and thus seek to forge their own legend. Feyspire Magic. Eladrin born of the Feyspires possess the magic of the Feyspire itself. Choose one of the Feyspires listed below. You gain the ability to cast the cantrip associated with your Feyspire. Your initial choice of Feyspire is usually permanent; it is the Feyspire you were born in and the story of it and its Lord or Lady is a driving force for your own story. However, it is possible to forsake the story of your birth spire and swear allegiance to a new one. Typically, the Lord or Lady of your new spire will demand a service or quest, usually demanding you accept a geas spell cast upon you, and when you complete this quest, you lose the cantrip associated with your former Feyspire, and gain the cantrip granted by your new one. 

Your spellcasting ability for your Feyspire cantrip is Intelligence or Charisma, whichever is higher. 
 
Feyspire Cantrip Pylas Pyrial, the Gate of Joy friends Shae Joridal, the City of Emerald Lights dancing lights Shae Lora Lyndar, the City of Rose and Thorn thorn whip Shaelas Tiraleth, the Court of the Silver Tree guidance Taer Lian Doresh, the Fortress of Fading Dreams minor illusion Taer Syraen, the Winter Citadel ray of frost  
Though called "wild" by their courtly kin within the Feyspires, eladrin who's stories eb and flow with the seasons are no less magically adept. Though they used to run free and cavort in the wilds with other fey, the sudden absence of the Feyspires has caused these wild eladrin to feel an ache in their souls; a compliment to themselves has been lost. Some few have traveled to the material plane, a place of quickening, withering, and pointless sorrow, to help their wayward cousins home. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2. Alignment. Eladrin of the wilds of Thelanis often follow flighty and carefree storylines, unlike their cousins in the Feyspires, tending toward chaotic alignments and capricious behavior. Those few who have taken it upon themselves to travel to the material plane to aid the Feyspires tend toward good alignments as they are likely following heroic tales filled with compassion and a drive to protect those needing aid. Seasonal Moods. Wild eladrin's stories are associated with the changing seasons. Unlike the material plane, the seasons on Thelanis seem to change with the mood of the plane's occupants. When you finish a long rest, you may choose a season of your liking and adopt it, changing your physical form to match. Regardless of your form, you remain recognizable as your previous self. Your chosen season represents a mood or narrative tone that you take on: Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all. When you assume this season, your skin, hair, and eyes take on autumnal colors of reds and yellows. 
Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers. When you assume this season, your features show a pallet of muted purples, pale blues, and snow white. Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, market by merriment as winter's sorrow passes. In this season, the hues of your body become vibrant and pastels, the color of wild spring flowers. Summer is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy. While in this season, golden yellows and vivid blues mark your appearance. Wild Step. When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step trait gains an additional effect based on the season to which your story currently follows; if the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. Autumn. Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to it. Winter. When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Spring. When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. Summer. Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage). 

Born from a merging between Dreams and Reality, kalashtar possess an unearthly serenity. As compound beings, the kalashtar have a both a human mind, body, and soul, and a connection to an incorporeal entity of dreams called a quori. Each quori spirit is divided among a bloodline of kalashtar, making the connection too tenuous to allow perfect communication, though every kalashtar can feel their patron spirit guide them, unlocking the secrets of psionic power and acting as a kind of second conscience. Driven to battle against Darkness, many kalashtar take up arms in this spiritual war only metaphorically, preferring to meditate on the Great Light. But there are plenty among them who start the life of an adventurer, calling themselves "shadow walkers", taking a more active role in the fight, confronting evil where they can. Some kalashtar are orphans, raised outside of their culture and heritage, leading to confusion and isolation as their natural powers manifest and set them apart from their human peers. Many of these orphaned kalashtar pursue a life of adventuring to relieve themselves of the feelings of ostracization. Some even become mentally unbalanced, alienated by the influence of their patron spirit, unable to explain or escape the second ego living inside their minds. Racial Traits. Kalashtar racial traits can be found on page 62 of the Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron. 
If your game uses the rules to incorporate psionics into your game, consider giving Kalashtar the following bonus racial traits: Naturally Psionic. You have a reservoir of psi points. At 1st level, the psi point maximum for your reservoir is 1, or your psi point maximum from another source (such as mystic class levels) increases by 1. At every odd-numbered level after 1st, your existing psi point maximum increases by an additional 1 psi point. Metaconcert. You may speak to more than one creature at a time with your Mind Link ability. By spending psi points (up to your psi limit), you gain the ability to project your telepathic speech into the mind of one additional creature per psi point spent for ten minutes. When you speak telepathically to more than one creature this way, all creatures thus spoken to gain the ability to speak telepathically to you and all creatures that you telepathically addressed— simultaneously—until the start of your next turn.

First appearing in the Towering Wood of the Eldeen Reaches millennia ago, the killoren population has since dwindled to a mere fraction of what it once was. The ancient among them tell of a time when insanity incarnate threatened the natural world, and the druidic orcs and militaristic Dhakaani Empire fought to stem the tide. But in the end, they say, it was the appearance of the killoren that allowed victory, bolstering the orc and goblinoid armies with their numbers, and adding the very might of nature to their cause. Though immortal, killoren can die from violence or accident as readily as any human, and the race seems almost driven to prove this point. Throwing themselves into Khyber, the Demon Wastes, and the wilder reaches of the Shadow Marches to do battle with the demonic, the aberrant, and the monstrous, killoren adventurers are more common amongst their number than civilians. A great many killoren now look east toward the Mournland, itching for vengeance against what caused such a malignant blight upon the natural world. In fact, since the Day of Mourning four years ago, the number of killoren births seems to be on the rise... Racial Traits. The following racial traits can be used to play a killoren in Eberron campaigns. 
Your killoren character has the following traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution and Wisdom scores increase by 1. Age. Killoren mature to adulthood within a decade, and do not die from old age, nor do they grow infirm with time. Size. Killoren are roughly the same size as elves, though drastically different in appearance otherwise. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Fey Blood. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. You are also fey, not humanoid, and spells and effects only detect and affect you as such. Natural Heart. Killoren have strong intuition about the natural world. You have proficiency with Nature checks. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Manifest Nature's Might. Killoren are forever bound to the raw forces of nature itself, manifesting this bond even in their physical form. A killoren can only manifest one aspect of nature’s might at a time. After taking a long rest, you can spend 10 minutes in quiet meditation as the sun rises, filling your spirit with an aspect of nature. Once you have chosen an aspect to manifest, you gain the traits of that aspect until you choose a new one. Although killoren can change their aspect from day to day, many killoren favor one aspect over the others and rarely choose to manifest one of the other two aspects. The three aspects are Ancient, Destroyer, and Hunter. 
While manifesting the aspect of the ancient, you embody the deep and ancient secrets of nature itself. Your hair turns white and your eyes turn to the color of a blue summer sky. Ancient Knowledge. You may cast your mind into the deep well of history as an action. At the end of one minute of concentration (as though concentrating on a spell), you may make an Intelligence check to recall any sort of lore (such as that covered by the Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion skills). You are considered proficient with this check and add double your proficiency bonus on the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. 

Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before you may do so again. Naturespeak. You know the druidcraft cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the speak with animals spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the speak with plants spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. 
Many revere nature for its raw power and devastation, but none more so than you while manifesting the aspect of the destroyer. Your eyes turn a deep lusterless black and your gaze becomes highly disturbing Frightening Avatar. You have proficiency with Charisma (Intimidate) checks, but you have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks. Devastation. You harbor an unyielding hatred of the unnatural. As a bonus action, you can designate one target you can see that is not a beast, elemental, fey, humanoid, or plant. For 1 minute, whenever you make a melee weapon attack against the target, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. At 9th level this increases to a +3 bonus on damage rolls, and at 16th level this increases to a +4 bonus on damage rolls. Once you use this trait, you may not do so again until you have finished a short or long rest. 
The hunt affects nearly every aspect of nature and claims a place of great prominence and importance in the cycle of life. While you manifest the aspect of the hunter, you are bound to the essence of the hunt, and your senses sharpen to an amazing degree. Your hair and eyes turn a deep forest green, and your skin tone becomes a deeper brown than when manifesting one of the other aspects. Mask of the Wild. You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena. The Hunt. As a bonus action, you can mark one creature you can see within 10 feet of you. Until the end of your next long rest, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make to find the marked creature, and you always know the location of that creature if it is within 60 feet of you. You can’t use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest. Wildsense. If you are surprised at the start of combat, you can still move and take your action on your first turn of combat, and you can take a reaction as soon as you finish your turn. 

The progeny of mortal bloodlines tainted with fiendish heritage or malign planar influence, tieflings are a rare sight in the more civilized nations of Khorvaire. Racial Traits. The below tiefling racial traits replace those found in the , to more readily present the are many origins of those with fiendish blood. 
Regardless of origin, all tieflings have some common traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score Age. Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer. Alignment. Tiefling alignments vary wildly, depending on their fiendish origin. Size. Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Subrace. Unlike most campaign settings, there are four subraces of tieflings in Eberron: Manifest, Sakah, and Venomous tieflings. Choose one of these subraces. 
Tieflings born through random chance vary wildly in appearance; Some have sweeping horns, goat-pupiled yellow eyes, or forked tongues. They may or may not have tails of all shapes and sizes, and cloven feet may be present or not. Myriad signs of their defiled blood manifest themselves in all manner of ways. Although such tieflings owe their existence to the influence of another plane, they can vary wildly in origin. They might have an otherwise normal heritage, but the influence of a plane altered them at birth. Others might count themselves as descendants of both a mortal and a fiend from one of these planes. Regardless of how they came to be, manifest tieflings draw their powers from the infusion of dark planar energies in their blood. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Alignment. Manifest tieflings have varying backgrounds, but almost all have felt the temptation of evil in their lives. Often outcast from society and selfreliant, they tend toward chaotic alignments as well. Manifest Origin. Your fiendish blood has a specific malign plane of origin. Pick one of the planes listed on the Manifest Origin table below. This affects other traits you gain from your subrace. Manifest Resistance. You have resistance to one type of damage, depending on your manifest origin. If the corresponding plane lists a choice of two damage types, you select one and cannot change your choice. Manifest Legacy. You know one cantrip, depending on your choice of origin. Once you reach 3rd level and 5th level, you can cast additional spells as indicated on the Manifest Origin table. When you gain these spells at the indicated levels, you can cast each spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one of the following languages: Abyssal, Infernal, Primordial (any one dialect), or Undercommon.

The Sakah are the most rarely encountered tieflings outside of the Demon Wastes. In their wasteland of a home, they are known as "Touched Ones", since their demonic taint is believed to be due to the touch of a Demonic Overlord. Few sakah desire to leave their savage, brutal lives. Sakah typically rise to the position of leadership among the hordes of barbaric carrion tribes due to their physical prowess and mental cunning. Those who do decide to leave must somehow make it past the Ghaash’kala orc clans that guard the Labyrinth. These orcs believe all who exist within the Demon Wastes are tainted by evil beyond redemption and cannot be allowed to escape. In the case of the sakah, they might be correct... Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2. Alignment. Life among the carrion tribes is brutal, hard, and often short. Even sakah that escape most likely only do so only for dark, selfish motives like vengeance. A non-evil sakah is as likely to exist as a charitable dragon. Demonic Resistance. You have advantage on saving throws against disease and poison, and you have resistance against necrotic and poison damage. Demonic Legacy. You know the blade ward cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the false life spell once with this trait as a 2nd-level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the enlarge/reduce spell on yourself once with this trait, using only the spell's enlarge option. You regain the ability to cast this spell when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Abyssal. 
The vast majority of tieflings that walk the face of Eberron are the descendants of the nobility of Ohr Kaluun, a nation that once thrived in ancient Sarlona. The mage-lords of Ohr Kaluun forged dark pacts with infernal spirits beyond the material plane, empowering themselves and their progeny. Over generations, this taint accumulated until the first Kalunnite tieflings were born. When Ohr Kaluun was wiped out in the Sundering of Sarlona, a small number of tiefling nobles managed to flee with their retainers. They fled across the sea to western Khorvaire and established a hidden enclave that would become known as the Venomous Demesne. Until recently the Venomous Demesne was thought mere myth by the rest of Khorvaire. That changed when the Court of Four, the heads of the four noble houses of tieflings that ruled the Venomous Demesne, entered into a formal pact with the Daughters of Sora Kell and joined the nation of Droaam under their rule. Tieflings of the Venomous Demesne have a unified appearance, clearly displaying horns and other diabolic features, though they are possessed of a kind of dark beauty. They and their domain are referred to as "Venomous" not due to any predilection for or supernatural affinity with poisons, but rather due to their viper's nest-like society and culture. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma and Intelligence scores increase by 1. Alignment. The Venomous Demesne is possessed of a strongly insular society. Outsiders would consider most traditions needlessly cruel. As a whole, the Venomous Demesne is a lawful evil society, but individual tieflings can be of any alignment. Infernal Resistance. You have resistance to fire damage. Infernal Legacy. You know the thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the hellish rebuke spell once with this trait as a 2nd-level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the darkness spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal. 

classes & Subclasses

All of the classes found in the have their place in Eberron. Adventurers are rare, so the player characters in an campaign setting are amazing  heroes or explorers capable of more daring exploits than most people alive. 
The Artificer and Swordmage are new classes presented here, each with its own selection of subclasses. In addition to these new classes, each existing class will have its own section, detailing how new or existing subclasses can fit into the world of Eberron (sometimes with suggested mechanical alterations).  


Class Subclass Level Available Description Artificer Alchemical Mastery 1st Master the alchemical formulas for several alchemical items Artificer Automation Mastery 1st Construct your own signature homunculus to aid you in battle Artificer Elemental Mastery 1st Use the secrets of elemental binding to bind a mote of elemental power to your will and use it to empower your equipment Artificer Innovation Mastery 1st Create and improve all manner of useful tools and items Artificer Renegade Mastery 1st Improve yourself in your quest for self-perfection Artificer Spellcraft Mastery 1st Manipulate fundamental forces of magic to create altered effects Cleric Blood Domain 1st Unlock the divinity within your blood and siphon the same power from others Cleric Corruption Domain 1st Use the power of dark gods to twist and corrupt others Cleric Creation Domain 1st Heavily armored cleric with the power to affect constructs Cleric Greed Domain 1st Secure what belongs to you and punish those who want it Cleric Passion Domain 1st Aid your allies and harm your enemies with passion and fury Cleric Trade Domain 1st Divinely empowered to wield money and influence Druid Circle of Purity 2nd Disrupt and destroy the workings of unnatural magic Druid Circle of Ruin 2nd Channel the natural death and decay of all things Druid Circle of the Guardian 2nd Heavily armed and armored warrior that fights alongside a beast to protect the wilds Druid Circle of the Path 2nd A planar shepherd that can create temporary manifest zones of their chosen plane Druid Circle of the Seal 2nd Protect the material plane from fiends and aberrations Paladin Oath of Liberty 3rd Vow to protect the freedom of others, mind, body, and soul Paladin Oath of the Unbroken 3rd A warforged-only oath to protect and guide others of your kind Ranger Eldeen Hunter 3rd A variant of the standard hunter subclass, with secrets learned from Eldeen druids Ranger Urban Soul 3rd Feel the eb and flow of the city and explore it with a tiny beast companion Sorcerer Apex Dragonmark 1st Manifest a true dragonmark with truly epic potential Sorcerer Child of Khyber 1st Manifest the most powerful aberrant dragonmark seen for millennia Wizard Generalist 2nd Study the breadth and depth of arcane sciences to always be prepared Swordmage Axiom of Assault 3rd Focus your magic on devastating attacks and mobility Swordmage Axiom of Command 3rd Lead your allies and magically empower them to ensure victory Swordmage Axiom of Division 3rd Outwit, outmaneuver, and out-cast your foes to conquer them Swordmage Axiom of Fortitude 3rd Channel your arcane might to fortify yourself and your allies  

aftificer

Dashing down the hall, pursued by Emerald Claw soldiers, a khoravar reaches into her satchel and tosses down a vial behind her. With a crash, the vial shatters and exposes its contents to air, producing a thick viscous smoke. Grinning, the khoravar continues on, leaving her pursuers choking on her alchemical dust. A goblin walks through the lower wards of Sharn, unmolested by criminals and thugs despite his small stature. The three-hundred-pound dog made from iron walking obediently beside him may have something to do with it. A human he raises an arm to defend himself from an assassin’s strike. The assailant’s blade clangs against the human’s arm. His true arm. A constructed prosthesis of pumping pistons and reinforced steel. They called him mad, but the human is laughing now. Artificers study magic and learn how to incorporate them into the items they create, from potions to constructs, to even their own bodies. The study of magic items and artifacts drives them to explore outside of their labs, as they delve into ancient ruins to uncover the secrets of artificers of the past, and. 
The artificer is a virtuoso of the practical application of arcane theory. While the wizard studies how to shape magic into spells and advance the boundaries of arcane sciences, the artificer sees magic on a fundamental level. They are experts at channeling arcane energies into objects, crafting potent temporary magic items to wield that magical force. In many ways, the artificer is the backbone of Eberron’s advanced magical technology. The greatest modern marvels of magic—the lightning rail, elemental airships, even the warforged—were all the products of these arcane geniuses. 
 
Adventuring artificers lend their support to their allies with their arcane magic. The main strength of artificers is their versatility—an artificer almost always has an answer to a given problem, so long as he has the time and resources to devote to building a solution to it. In a party with warforged, the artificer can function as a secondary or primary healer, as they can repair constructs as easily as a cleric heals wounds.

The other Artificer
The artificer class presented here is a close adaptation of the class as it originally appeared in the 3.5 Campaign Setting sourcebook. It is an attempt at ensuring the artificer class has the same place in the lore and adventuring party as was originally intended. But what if you would rather play the artificer class as it appears in Unearthed Arcana? That class has an entirely different feel that the original one, more of an arcane tinkerer than a skilled manipulator of the fundamental threads of magic. That class is seen as the “half-caster” version of the magic of artifice—the paladin or ranger to the artificer’s cleric or druid. Since both classes are viable for an Eberron game, it is recommended to rename the “half-caster” artifice class the “Arcanic” (an “arcane mechanic”). 

When you begin creating your artificer, you must first decide what field of artifice you strove to master. Much like choosing an academic field to study, your field of mastery evokes what you find most interesting about magic. Do you love to experiment and design? Do you work your magic into artifices the goal of selfimprovement? However, you must also decide what has caused you to seek a life of adventure. The life of opening up a shop and creating trinkets is for mere magewrights, but as an artificer, you are a genius in your field. Do you seek valuable data by testing your creations in realworld applications? Perhaps you seek to uncover the artifice techniques of civilizations long past and need to leave the laboratory behind to seek out the ruins that might be full of ancient secrets. Or is artifice just a means to an end for you, a skill you’ve developed to empower yourself to achieve unrelated goals? 
 
A quick way to make an artificer is to follow these guidelines. Make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the House Guildmember (Tinker’s Guild) background.
 
 
 
 
As an artificer, you gain the following class features. 
 
Hit Dice: 1d8 per artificer level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1st 
 
Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: All simple weapons and hand crossbows Tools: Artificer’s tools 
 
Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom Skills: Arcana and two from the following: History, Insight, Investigation, Perception 
 
 
 
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: 
 
• A simple melee weapon • (a) leather armor, (b) chain mail • (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) a shield • Artificer’s tools • An Inventor’s pack • Raw materials required to make custom spellcasting foci that do not have a cost 
 
You approach the study of arcane arts differently from a wizard. While they research to control the essence of magic with speech and gesture, you experiment with ways to infuse magic's arcane threads through the physical world around you. You cast spells a bit differently from other spellcasters, (see Custom Spellcasting Focus and Jury-Rigged Rituals below), but you follow the general rules of spellcasting as detailed in chapter 10 of the . The artificer spell list is detailed at the end of the artificer description. 
 
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. You learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table. 
 
The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your artificer level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell repair damage, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. 
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent in contemplation and brainstorming: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. 
 
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells, since your ability to formulate magic into spell effects comes from your skill and ingenuity. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
 
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier 
 
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier 
 
You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. When you cast a ritual, it is less of a ceremonious affair and more a scramble to create a temporary magic item to activate the spell's effect. When you cast a spell as a ritual, there is a special requirement cost to cast it; objects, supplies, and raw materials worth at least 10 gold per spell level. These supplies are not expended in casting the ritual and can be salvaged and reused for later rituals. 
 
You cannot fulfill the material component of artificer spells you cast, unless they have a notable cost. Instead, you use any type of Artisan's tools (usually Artificer's tools) to construct an improvised device that produces the spell's effect, functioning as a spellcasting focus. Constructing this device is part of the casting time of the spell and counts as the spell's somatic components. An artificer must have both hands free to construct a custom spellcasting focus. Your custom device can be reused the next time you cast the same spell it was constructed for, unless the spell specifies that its material component is consumed. In that case, the custom spellcasting focus falls apart after the spell's duration is over (or immediately for spells with an instantaneous duration). Reusing a custom spellcasting focus requires only one hand for casting a spell. Drawing a 

 
  
previously made custom spellcasting focus and stowing it are part of casting time of the spell. 
Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability checks you make using the Arcana skill or Artificer's tools. In addition, choose one field of the artificer's arts that you have focused in above all others. Each field of mastery is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you additional artificer spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use your Infusions when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. 
 
Each field of mastery has a list of spells—its mastery spells—that you gain at the artificer levels noted in the mastery description. Once you gain a mastery spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a mastery spell that doesn't appear on the artificer spell list, the spell is nonetheless an artificer spell for you. 
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to shape magic energy directly from the world around you to create magical effects. You start with one such effect: Personal Weapon Augmentation. When you reach 2nd level, you also gain an effect determined by your field of mastery. At 5th level, you gain the Instant Armor Augmentation effect. Some fields of mastery also grant additional Infusions as you advance in levels, as noted in the mastery description. When you use your Infusions, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Infusions again. Some Infusion effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your artificer spell save DC. At 6th, 14th, and 18th level, you can use your Infusions an additional time between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. 
 
As either an action or a bonus action, you may enhance a weapon you are holding. If you enhance a weapon with the ammunition property, it confers any augmentation to ammunition loaded and fired from it. 
For the 10 minutes or until you let go of the weapon, you gain one of the following benefits: Disrupting Weapon. +1d6 radiant damage, sheds bright light in 20-foot radius and dim light in an additional 20 feet. Flame Tongue. +1d6 fire damage, and you gain fire resistance. Frost Brand. +1d6 cold damage, and you gain cold resistance. 
 
Starting at 5th level, you can use an Infusion to enhance an outfit or suit of armor that you touch, just in the nick of time. As either an action or reaction, you can select one of the following benefits. The Infusion lasts for 10 minutes. If you are using the Infusion as a reaction, you may only do so when you or an ally you can see within 5 feet of you are hit by an attack or are affected by a spell, and the wearer of the outfit or suit of armor gains its benefit against the triggering attack or spell. Resonant Harmonics. The wearer gains thunder resistance and an area with a radius of 5 feet around them ignores the effects of magical silence. Force Ward. The wearer gains force resistance and if an effect moves the wearer against their will (including the triggering effect), the distance they are moved is reduced by up to 10 feet. Vitality Seal. The wearer gains necrotic resistance and their hit point maximum cannot be reduced by an attack that deals necrotic damage. 
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 
Beginning at 10th level, you may spend one workday of downtime to dismantle a magic item and reverse engineer the schema necessary to create it (see the rules for creating magic items starting on page 46 of the Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron for more about schema). You record the schema in a series of symbolic notations that only makes sense to yourself and other artificers. (Many accomplished artificers maintain a book of schema that they safeguard against theft or duplication from rival artificers.) The item you dismantle is destroyed, and the physical components used to make it cannot be reused. 

 
Artifacts, cursed items, sentient items, and constructs cannot be dismantled. At 20th level, you can dismantle a magic item in such a way that you can reassemble it within the same workday you spent dismantling it, reverse engineering its formula without destroying the original item. 
 
If your game allows the optional rules for Multiclassing found on page 163 of the , a character can multiclass into and out of the artificer class as they can with other classes. Multiclass artificers follow the normal multiclassing rules, with the following notes: 
 
Artificer Intelligence 13 
 
Artificer Light armor, medium armor, simple weapons 
When you gain a new level in the artificer class, you gain its features. 
 
When multiclassing in artificer and another spellcasting class that grants spell slots, add your total artificer level to determine your total number of spell slots. 
Artifice magic has been a driving factor in the development of modern society on Khorvaire and is one of the hallmarks of the campaign setting. There are many facets of the study of artifice, and your choice of which field to assert your mastery in signifies where you focus your creativity and drive for perfection. 
 
Artificers who focus on mastering alchemy continuously mix and concoct strange potions and substances, experimenting to improve formulas for their strange solutions. 
 
Artificer Level Spells 1st chromatic orb, grease 3rd heat metal, Melf's acid arrow 5th transmute weapon, stinking cloud 7th fire shield, stoneskin 9th transmute rock*, wall of stone *This spell can be found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything 
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability checks you make using them. Additionally, you have mastered three formulas for the creation of alchemical items. You know the formula for brewing alchemist's fire and the formulas to brew or transmute two additional kinds of items of your choice: antitoxin, alchemical acid, alchemical frost, alchemical lightning, explosive oil, oil of repair, potions of healing, smoke sticks, sunrods, tanglefoot bags, or thunderstones. (New items detailed in Chapter 4: Equipment.) To craft an alchemical item, you require one workday (8 hours) of downtime and a set of alchemist's supplies, plus additional raw materials worth half of the item's market price in gold pieces. Items you create this way are nonmagical, except for oils of repair and potions of healing. Unlike store-bought items, if an alchemical item you create requires a saving throw to resist any of its effects, the DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier (using your proficiency bonus and Intelligence modifier at the time you created the item). As you grow in level, your alchemical knowledge grows more refined as well, allowing you to increase the potency of some items you create. If the item’s 

  
effect involves dice, it gains an additional die at artificer levels 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th when you create it. (For instance, basic alchemical acid deals 1d6 acid damage, but if you are 13th level, any alchemical acid you create can deal 7d6 acid damage). For each additional dice an item's effect has, you need to spend one extra workday and an additional 25% of its market value in gold pieces to craft it. You can choose to create an alchemical item that is less potent than the maximum potency you are capable of creating. If a creature other than you employs an alchemical item you create with greater than normal effects, it retains its increased potency. 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use an Infusion to transmute a harmless liquid or object into an alchemical concoction or item as an action. You can create any nonmagical alchemical item you know the formula for. Any item you create is created at your maximum potency. The item retains its new properties for 10 minutes, or until used. 
At 6th level, you learn two additional formulas for creating alchemical items, picked from among those available to you at 1st level. 
At 8th level, your experiments or reverse engineering have unlocked the secrets of dangerous alchemical formulas not typically available on the market. You learn how to create two alchemical items from the following list: absentia, alchemical wrath, dragon's blood (black), dragon's blood (blue). All of these items are nonmagical. 
Starting at 17th level, you learn two additional formulas for creating alchemical items, picked from among those available to you at 1st or 8th level, and the following list: dragon's blood (red), goodberry wine. Of these options, goodberry wine is considered a magical item. 
 
Some artificers are focused on the nature of constructs and hone their intellect toward repairing, maintaining, and creating them. They are typically hardier than other artificers, often wading into battle beside their signature homunculi. 
 
Artificer Level Spells 1st cause damage*, repair damage* 3rd magic weapon, methods of repair* 5th mass emergency repairs*, reactivate* 7th death ward, stoneskin 9th mass repair damage*, reconstruct* *These new spells are detailed in Chapter 3: Character Options 
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use an Infusion to force a construct or warforged to temporarily cease all functions. As an action, you cause one construct or warforged that can see you within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. If the target fails its saving throw, it is affected by this ability for 1 minute. While it is affected by this Infusion, the target can take no actions or reactions and it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Additionally, attack rolls against it have advantage, and any attack that hits the target is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of it. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, this effect ends. 
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to invest a construct with a portion of your soul, binding it to you as a homunculus. You must spend four workweeks of downtime and 500 gold to construct one. Choose a construct creature no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (see the Homunculus section of The Korranberg Chronicle: Threat Dispatch starting on page 45 for constructs particularly suitable for this ability). After construction is complete, you imbue the construct with a portion of your soul, transforming it into a homunculus. Your homunculus shares your alignment. Your homunculus accompanies you on your adventures and faithfully fights alongside you. Add your proficiency bonus to the homunculus's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws 

 
and skills it is proficient in. The creature has a total number of hit dice equal to your level, or it's normal total, whichever is higher. For every hit die it has, its hit points increase accordingly. Each level you gain after 6th, your homunculi gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. For every 4 hit die the homunculus has, its ability scores improve. Your homunculus can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your homunculus can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise. Your homunculus can't gain feats unless otherwise noted. Your homunculus obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated, your companion acts on its own. Your homunculus remains active as long as it is within 100 feet of you. It becomes unconscious and inert if you ever move further away. If your homunculus is destroyed, a piece of your soul is lost and you suffer a –4 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time you complete a long rest, this penalty lessens by 1. Once you no longer have this penalty, you can craft a new homunculus by spending another four workweeks of downtime and 500 gold. You cannot have more than one signature homunculus active at a time. Should you begin crafting a new signature homunculus, the old one collapses into wasted raw materials after you finish one workday of progress toward crafting the new one (and you suffer the penalty above, since the old homunculus is destroyed). However, if you select the Craft Homunculus feat (described in a later chapter), you 
can craft a second homunculus and have both it and your signature homunculus active at the same time. Homunculi you create with the create homunculus spell from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything do not count toward this limit, and vice versa. 
At 8th level, when you use the Attack action on your turn, if your signature homunculus can see you, it can use its reaction to make a melee attack. Additionally, while your signature homunculus can see you, it has advantage on all saving throws. 
At 17th level, you complete your final adjustments to your signature homunculus. Pick one of the following features for your signature homunculus. In gains the selected feature permanently. Once you make your choice, you cannot change it unless you construct a new signature homunculus. Adamantine Defense. Your signature homunculus has resistance to all damage. Amalgamate Essence. When you use an infusion on yourself or cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your signature homunculus with the infusion or spell if the homunculus is within 30 feet of you. Mithral Wings. Your signature homunculus gains a fly speed of 60 feet, or its existing fly speed increases by 30 feet. While flying, it can hover. In addition, your signature homunculus doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach. Quicksilver Fury. Your signature homunculus can use its Action to make two melee weapon attacks against a single creature, or one melee weapon attack against each creature of its choice within 5 feet of it, with a separate attack roll for each target. 
 
  
The secrets of elemental binding are behind some of the most famous inventions of Khorvaire’s artificers, including the wondrous lightning rail and elemental airships of House Orien and House Lyrandar. Masters of elemental binding channel the primal power of conjured elementals into their works of artifice to enhance and empower them. 
 
Restriction. You must know the secrets of elemental binding to select this mastery. Currently, the techniques to bind elementals are known only to the gnomes of Zilargo and the Sulatar drow, but with the DM's permission, it is possible that someone might be taught by an individual from these cultures or discover the art on their own. However, the Zil and Sulatar would both be very concerned if their secrets were to be “stolen”. 
 
Artificer Level Spells 1st absorb elements*, conjure elemental mote † 3rd arcane lock, locate object 5th elemental weapon, magic circle 7th conjure minor elementals, charm monster* 9th conjure elemental, planar binding *These spells can be found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything †This new spell is detailed in Chapter 3: Character Options 
Artificers with a mastery in binding elementals begin the game with a single Khyber dragonshard worth 50 gp, sufficient for the material component of the conjure elemental mote spell. 
Starting at 1st level, whenever you cast conjure elemental mote, the conjured mote's hit point maximum increases by 3 for every artificer level you have. Additionally, the mote gains an extra dice of its damage on its damage rolls when you reach 5th level, and then an additional extra die at 11th and 17th level. (For example, at 11th level, an air mote you conjure would deal 3d4 + 3 lightning damage with its Discharge attack.) Finally, should the elemental mote be reduced to 0 hit points, as a reaction you may attempt an Arcana check with a DC equal to 10 + the damage of the attack that reduced the elemental mote to 0 hit points. If your check succeeds, the elemental mote is still destroyed, 
but the khybershard at its core does not burn out, retaining its worth so it can be reused as the material component for conjure elemental mote again. 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use an Infusion to cause a damaged elemental creature to begin reconstituting its form. Choose one elemental creature that doesn't have all of its hit points you can see within 30 feet. For 1 minute, that elemental creature heals an amount of hit points at the start of its turn equal to your Intelligence modifier, unless the creature has more than half of its hit points. 
At 6th level, you have devised how to channel bound elemental motes into a protective matrix around a suit of armor. If you have summoned an elemental mote and have taken an action to suppress it into its khybershard core, you may spend one workday of downtime (8 hours) integrating the khybershard into any suit of armor. While integrated this way, the khybershard cannot be targeted separately, and the elemental bound inside it has total cover against all spells and effects. When worn, the augmented suit of armor functions as armor of resistance ( , pg. 152), granting the wearer resistance to one type of damage the bound elemental is resistant or immune to itself (your choice, made at the time you finish integrating the khybershard into the armor).  The elemental mote still exists, and you cannot summon another one while it and the armor remain intact. You may spend an additional workday of downtime to safely remove the elemental's khybershard from the armor, restoring it to elemental mote form. 
At 8th level, you have perfected the techniques for binding elemental motes into weapons, channeling the primal magic of their element for offensive power. If you have summoned an elemental mote and have taken an action to suppress it into its khybershard core, you may spend 8 hours integrating the khybershard into any weapon. While integrated this way, the khybershard cannot be targeted separately, and the elemental bound inside it has total cover against all spells and effects. The elementally bound weapon is as a magical weapon, and gains an additional effect depending on the nature of the bound elemental mote as follows: 

 
Air Mote. The weapon deals an extra 1d6 lightning damage on each hit. Earth Mote. The wielder of the weapon gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls made with it. Fire Mote. The weapon deals an extra 1d6 fire damage on each hit. Water Mote. The weapon deals an extra 1d6 cold damage on each hit. Ranged weapons confer these bonuses to their ammunition.  The elemental mote still exists, and you cannot summon another one while it and the weapon remain intact. You may spend an additional workday of downtime to safely remove the elemental's khybershard from the weapon, restoring it to elemental mote form. 
Starting at 17th level, you have mastered elemental binding. You may now incorporate any conjured elemental you have bound to a khybershard into elementally empowered items.  When binding an elemental mote to a suit of armor or a weapon, you can make the binding permanent if you spend an additional workday of downtime enhancing the binding, along with additional raw materials worth 1,000 gp. If the binding becomes permanent, the elemental spirit is no longer considered your conjured mote for the conjure elemental mote spell, allowing you to conjure another one without dismissing the permanently bound spirit back to its home plane. If you bind an elemental creature other than an elemental mote (see sidebar), you can incorporate its khybershard into a suit of armor or weapon, requiring a number of workweeks of downtime equal to twice the elemental's challenge rating and additional raw materials equal to 1,000 gp times the elemental's challenge rating. When binding an elemental other than an elemental mote to a suit of armor, the armor now grants all of the elemental's resistances and immunities to the armor's wearer. When binding an elemental other than an elemental mote to a weapon, the weapon gains magical properties, depending on the nature of the elemental bound to the weapon: Elemental Air Creatures. The weapon gains the properties of a dancing sword ( , pg. 161), even if the weapon is not a sword. Elemental Earth Creatures. The wielder of the weapon has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. 
Elemental Fire Creatures. The wielder of the weapon has a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with it, and the weapon deals 2d6 extra fire damage on a hit. Elemental Water Creatures. The wielder of the weapon has a +1 bonus to attack rolls with it, and the weapon deals 2d6 extra cold damage on a hit Additionally, you can create additional elemental items. Many of these require a team of apprentice elemental binders, such as is the case with the creation of House Lyrandar’s elemental airships, which require months of painstaking work from teams of artificers, shipwrights, and engineers, in addition to your elemental binding mastery. A single item can only have one elemental bound to it (except under exceptional circumstances, such as the famed Golden Dragon, an elemental airship so large it requires two bound elementals to function). 
 
A spellcaster that knows the secrets of elemental binding and knows the planar binding spell can cast that spell with an alternate material component and produce a significantly different effect than normal. If you have this secret knowledge, then whenever you cast planar binding on an elemental creature, you may use a single Khyber dragonshard (also referred to as a "khybershard") worth an amount of gold pieces equal to 500 times the target creature's challenge rating as the spell's material component, instead of the spell's normal material component. If you do so and the elemental fails its Charisma saving throw, the khybershard is not consumed in casting the spell. Instead, the elemental creature is drawn into the khybershard and completely sealed within it. When cast this way, planar binding's duration is instantaneous. The elemental remains bound within the khybershard until the khybershard is physically destroyed (AC 10, 10 hit points per 500 gp it is worth), which frees the elemental into the nearest unoccupied space. Such a freed elemental is not under your control and does not follow your instructions. It remains on the current plane of existence it is freed into until another spell or effect transports it to another plane (such as banishment or the dismissal effect of dispel evil and good). A bound elemental creature and its khybershard do not produce any effects on their own but may be used as the rare component in the crafting of any of several elementally-empowered magic items, depending on its nature. 
 

 
 
 
  
Artificers who focus on mastering innovation constantly strive to create new inventions and better ways to use existing ones. 
 
Artificer Level Spells 1st identify, spell-storing item † 3rd enhance ability, spiritual weapon 5th bestow curse, remove curse 7th fabricate, stone shape 9th Bigby’s hand, creation †This new spell is detailed in Chapter 3: Character Options 
At 1st level, you learn the makeshift wand cantrip (detailed in Chapter 3: Character Options). When you do, you know 3 energy types with which to use it, instead of the normal 2. 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use an Infusion to temporarily modify an object with conjured additions and attachments that make it the perfect tool for whatever situation you are dealing with. As an action, choose one skill or tool. For the next 10 minutes (and as long as you have the object) you have proficiency with the chosen skill or tool. 
At 6th level, you can use an infusion in place of using your Inspiration or spending Hit Dice to reduce the casting time of spell-storing item to 1 action, no matter what spell level you cast it from. 
At 8th level, your design philosophy for your inventions becomes more intuitive, allowing creatures less knowledgeable than yourself to understand and use your creations. You gain the following benefits: —When you use an Infusion to make a Perfect Tool, anyone can benefit from the object for the duration of the effect so long as they hold and use the Perfect Tool. —When you cast spell-storing item, any creature can activate the item to cast the spell you store in it. 
Starting at 17th level, you have the opportunity to create a singularly impressive magic item. If you have Inspiration, you may use it to spend one workweek of downtime to create a magic item of up to legendary rarity at no cost and without a schema or rare 
component. (Your DM has a list of appropriate magic items, such as those found in the Dungeon Master's Guide. You can also work with your DM to create a brand-new magic item.) You may only create one magic item this way; it is your finest invention. 
 
Renegade artificers are driven by a devotion to—or some would say obsession with—self-improvement. These artificers are called renegades because they ignore conventional wisdom and experiment upon themselves, improving their bodies by implanting and replacing parts of themselves with the products of their mad genius. 
 
Artificer Level Spells 1st repair damage †, thunderous smite 3rd magic weapon, methods of repair † 5th blinding smite, mass emergency repairs † 7th staggering smite, stoneskin 9th steel wind strike*, mass repair damage † *This spell can be found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything †These new spells are detailed in Chapter 3: Character Options 
At 1st level, you have taken the first major leap in your quest for self-improvement, something that clearly announced your lack of limits and marks you as a renegade. You replace one of your arms with a constructed prosthesis you refer to as a bionic arm. When you make an unarmed strike with your bionic arm, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier. 
Also starting at 1st level, your repair spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a construct or warforged, the target regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. 

 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use an Infusion to activate devices you've implanted in your body to repair yourself. As an action, you cause yourself to begin automatically repairing damage for 1 minute. For this duration, at the start of each of your turns, you regain a number of hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier, to a maximum of half of your normal hit point total. 
At 6th level, you have replaced so much of yourself with artificial components that your hit point maximum increased by 6 and increases by 1 whenever you gain another level in the artificer class. These artificial replacements also cause you to count as both a construct and a humanoid. You can be affected by a game effect if it works on either of your creature types. Additionally, you may attune to and attach warforged component magic items, even if you are not a warforged, so long as they do not require a specific warforged model type. 
At 8th level, you have woven countless infusions and layered numerous magical improvements into your bionic arm. At your option, you may replace your other arm with a second bionic arm as well. Whether you have one bionic arm or two, you gain the same benefits: —Your bionic arm(s) now count as magical weapons. —When you make an unarmed strike with a bionic arm you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. —Your bionic arm(s) are reinforced with extra plating. They function as the equivalent of a +1 magical shield, granting you a +3 bonus to Armor Class. This does not limit your ability to hold objects, cast spells, or wield weapons. — When you take the Attack action on your turn to make an unarmed strike with a bionic arm, you can make another unarmed strike as a bonus action. 
At 17th level, you have achieved your vision of perfection for yourself. If you are a warforged, any critical hit against you is treated as a normal hit. If you are any other kind of creature, you gain the Model Type and Remodeling racial traits of the warforged (see page 28 of this tome). You may now attune to warforged components that require the model type that you chose for the Model Type trait. No matter what kind of creature you were, you are no longer considered a humanoid, and are a construct only. You cannot be targeted by spells or affects that specifically target humanoids (such as dominate person), and you cannot be affected by spells that explicitly exclude constructs (such as cure wounds). 
 
  
Some artificers focus on the crafting of spells instead of objects. They have a wider breadth of study concerning spellcasting, and usually have access to more directly devastating magic. Experienced artificers in this field can perceive the fundamental building blocks of the spells, rearranging them with improvisational alterations on the fly. 
 
Artificer Level Spells 1st Detect magic, thunderwave 3rd scorching ray, hold person 5th fireball, lightning bolt 7th fire shield, phantasmal killer 9th telekinesis, cone of cold 
At 1st level, you learn one wizard cantrip of your choice. It counts as an artificer cantrip for you. 
Starting at 2nd level, as part of the casting time of casting a spell, you can expend an Infusion to alter the spell’s formula as you cast it. When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type with one other type from that list (you can change only one damage type per casting of a spell). 
At 6th level, as part of the casting time of casting a nonabjuration or non-divination spell, you can spend an infusion to change the basic nature of a spell, changing its school of magic into any other school, except abjuration or divination. If you change the spell's school and it requires a saving throw to resist its affects, the spell's saving throw changes depending on its new school of magic: Conjuration. Strength. Enchantment. Wisdom. Evocation. Dexterity. Illusion. Intelligence. Necromancy. Charisma. Transmutation. Constitution. If the spell normally has a reduced effect even on a successful saving throw, the changed spell has no effect if affected creatures succeed on their save. For instance, a fireball changed to a conjuration or illusion spell would deal no damage if a creature in its area of effect succeeded on their Strength or Intelligence saving throw, instead of half damage. 
The spell's new school must conceivably be able to produce the base spell's effects. If your chosen school cannot do so (such as an illusory dimension door that does not actually transport yourself), the spell fails, but you do not expend a spell slot or an Infusion. Work with your DM to determine what the limits of each spell school are, and how far you can stretch a desired spell. If you have two or more uses of your Infusions remaining, you can expend two uses in order to affect a single spell with both Arcane Alteration and Energy Modulation during its casting time. 
At 8th level, you add your Intelligence modifier to the damage you deal with any artificer cantrip. 
Starting at 17th level, whenever you prepare your artificer spells, you may select a number of wizard spells to prepare as if they were on the artificer spell list. The maximum number of spells you can prepare this way is equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Barbarians are fierce warriors that channel their rage to shrug off wounds as they wade into battle, heedless of their own recklessness. Below are some suggestions on incorporating barbarian primal paths into the world of Eberron. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 121 Restriction: None. In Eberron, the battlerager is not a particularly dwarven notion, and as such it has no restriction on race. Battleragers are berserkers of incredible fury and recklessness. The Ancient Empire of Dhakaani often employed hulking bugbear battlerager shock troops, trained and indoctrinated to sublimate their consciousness during battle. Many young, tempestuous dragonborn seek glory in combat without a thought for self-preservation. During the Last War, some warforged juggernauts were constructed for breaking sieges and were trained to fight in a similar manner. 
A warforged barbarian that choses the path of the battlerager at 3rd level grows armor spikes directly from their own body’s plating. This substitutes the requirement to wear spiked armor in any subclass features that require it, as the warforged battlerager always has armor spikes. 
, pg. 49 Eberron has many savage cultures which epitomize the berserker, such as the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes, frenzied razorclaw shifters from the Eldeen Reaches, or howling dinosaur-riding halflings of the Talenta Plains. However, not all barbarians are foreign to the civilized Thronehold Nations. Some barbarians are well-mannered folk who lose control when they enter combat, or deliberately enter a “battle trance” that sublimates their higher thinking. This can be the result of years of training, or perhaps an alchemical accident has left the character with an alternate personality— the Berserker—that only emerges during times of danger. 
, pg. 50 and Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 121 The path of the totem warrior is likely to appear in several primal cultures, such as the Seren Isles and the Talenta Plains. A barbarian from any culture has access to all known spirit totems, including the elk and tiger totems from the Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, but barbarians from the Seren Isles, or dragonborn barbarians from Q'barra, might know these totems by more draconic aspects. Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron lists alternate aspects for the Bear, Eagle, and Wolf totems that links them to dinosaurs. Those are reproduced here, and the elk and tiger aspects are added as well. 
 
Totem Draconic Aspect Dinosaur Aspect Bear Blue or Bronze Hammertail (ankylosaurs) Eagle Black or Silver Glidewing (pteranodon) Wolf Brass or Green Clawfoot (deinonychus) Elk Copper or White Fastieth (leaellynasaura) Tiger Gold or Red Carver (utahraptor) 
 
 
 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 9 While many tribal societies revere their ancestors, the vast majority of barbarians who follow the path of the ancestral guardian come from elven cultures, and more specifically the Valenar elves of the Tairnadal. Such warriors are usually particularly devout toward their ancestor and the Spirits of the Past, and amongst the Tairnadal may be seen as the equivalent of a paladin. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 10 This new primal path lets you harness the rage of nature itself. These warriors are typically found in more extreme druidic sects, and some may even be cultists who venerate the Devourer of the Dark Six. However, some barbarians who follow the path of the storm herald are able to channel the power of destructive nature toward nobler ends, protecting the innocent with the might of the storm. Additionally, a barbarian following this path might be a dragonmarked half-elf of House Lyrandar, with an unusually potent dragonmark, allowing them to channel the fury of the storm in ways unusual to the House. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 11 Warriors that fight with the blind ferocity of the truly devout can be found throughout Khorvaire, but barbarians who follow the Path of the Zealot are much more likely to be civilized people, citizens of the Five Nations. When battle is met, they unleash themselves and fight with utter abandon. While evil barbarians of the Path of the Zealot are likely to worship the Devourer, the Passion, or the Dark Six as a whole, most non-evil warriors of this primal path worship Dol Dorn or the Silver Flame. Zealot barbarians are also found among the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes, as the ferocity in which they fight for Kalok Shash, the Binding Flame, aids in their divine mission to keep evil from escaping the Labyrinth. 
 

  
Bards in the world of Eberron are inspiring storytellers, intrepid reporters, or talented musicians. They are often beloved by the common folk, and particularly talented individuals are invited to noble galas and dragonmarked soirees. It is here that bards often employ their secondary talent for accumulating and distributing gossip. Below are some suggestions on incorporating bard colleges into the world of Eberron. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 14 While many bards of the college of glamour learn their trade by studying under or observing various fey, many more bards of this college learn its secrets under the tutelage of House Phiarlan. The House recognizes talent and will accept, and heartily welcome, anyone with enough artistic potential, whether they are related to the House or not. Those bards with a knack for the illusion magic House Phiarlan is known for will find the house's guilds and art institutions a wonderful place to glean and hone their abilities. 
, pg. 54 Lore college bards are likely to have studied at institutions of higher learning, such as the Library of Korranberg or Morgrave University. Their expanded breadth of study lends them a vague air of greater legitimacy than traveling minstrels, and many might be tenured provosts or lecturers in the employ of their favored institution. 
Unearthed Arcana: Kits of Old, pg. 2 This is new bardic college presents the option to play the archetypical jester. In Khorvaire, such bards are often seen as champions of the common man, as they freely speak their mind about nobles and Dragonmarked heirs, often with a scathing tongue. Many satire bards are chroniclers for various broadsheets, writing satirical stories of their exploits that may or may not be heavily embellished. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 15 Bards of the college of swords use stunning weapon displays to inspire and intimidate, they are not just for show. These bards training in actual melee combat as well and are often heirs of, or employed by, House Phiarlan or Thuranni. They hide their actual martial prowess behind such flamboyant displays. 
, pg. 55 The Thronehold Accords signed two years ago just ended a massive hundred-year civil war. All nations had ample opportunity to test the mettle and valor of their soldiers. Valorous bards often proved themselves on the battlefields of the Last War, leading comrades in arms against daunting odds. The Valenar elves of Tairnadal are likely to consider bards of the college of valor religious leaders on par with clerics, as they perform the sacred function of preserving the epic tales and stories of the Tairnadal patron ancestors and inspiring the next generation of heroes and warriors. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 16 There is no one unified tradition of the college of whispers. Rather, whisper bards are expert spies and assassins, found in the employ of every nation, each nation having their own tradition. Members of each nation's intelligence agencies are trained as whisper bards if they show enough potential and there are rumors that the similarity of each nation's traditions might be due to a singular source, some continentwide organization that specializes in deception and secrecy that may have sold their secrets to the highest bidders. The fact that the rumors of the so-called “College of Whispers” began shortly after the Shadow Schism of House Phiarlan and House Thuranni only encourages such rumors. 
 
 
Just as in other D&D worlds, clerics are wielders of divine magic. However, the major difference in the Eberron campaign setting is that clerics are empowered by their faith alone, not channeling the direct power of their deity. This is because the existence of gods cannot be proven in an Eberron campaign setting. Spell or affect that normally explicitly references the interaction with a deity—such as the cleric’s Divine Intervention or the planar binding spell—still function in Eberron campaigns, but they do not actually contact a god. Instead, a powerful entity aligned with the cleric’s faith, such as a legendary solar angel, acts as an intermediary. But this entity has never actually encountered the god in question either; it is a being created through the incarnate belief in the god and exists because of that belief. The existence of the divine is entirely a matter of faith in Eberron. Additionally, there are several religions in Eberron that are actually philosophies, such as the Path of Light or the Blood of Vol. Clerics of these religions do not believe in or worship any god and rather gain their power by adherence to and belief in a way of life. Divine domains from the , , Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, and Xanathar’s Guide to Everything can be used in Eberron games, as well as domains from Unearthed Arcana articles that the DM allows. See the Faiths & Pantheons table for which domains are available to which religions. On the following pages, several new domains for Eberron campaigns are detailed, as well as a minor variation of the Grave domain. 
In addition to the faiths listed below, there are several smaller heretical religions that combine aspects of the Sovereign Host and Dark Six into small, combined pantheons. These smaller faiths often have access to domains that would not normally be available. Below are two examples of heretical pantheons. Three Faces of War. Many soldiers of the Five Nations worship the Three Faces of War, a single god whom they believe has three faces, represented by Dol Arrah, Dol Dorn, and the Mockery. War priests of this soldier’s religion have access to the Protection, Trickery, and War domains, not recognizing Dol Arrah's role in the Sovereign Host as the sun goddess, instead focusing on her compassionate, defensive approach to war. 
 
 
The Restful Watch. Followers of this faith believe that Aureon judges souls upon their passage from Dolurrh and those he deems worthy are entrusted to the Keeper's safekeeping. Priests of this faith have access to the Knowledge and Protection domains, as well as the Repose variant of the Grave domain, downplaying Aureon's role as a god of magic, and having a much more benevolent interpretation of the Keeper that does not include the more commonly accepted view of the dark god hoarding souls for his own greed. Rather, they insist that the souls the Keeper has are under his sincere stewardship.

Designed by Cephei_Delta, Reprinted here courtesy of The Dragon Above The Blood domain asserts that the ultimate divinity does not lie with the gods, but with the blood that sustains all living creatures. Seekers of the divinity within value mortal power above all, work to sustain life and the community, and aim to avoid death at all costs. Acolytes following the principles of this domain often have a complex relationship with the undead; intelligent undead may be pitied or hated for having lost their spark of the divine, or they may be venerated as tragic heroes having made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the faith. Deities of any alignment are unlikely to claim influence over this subversive domain. Instead, it is typified by anti-theistic faiths such as the Blood of Vol. 
 
Cleric Level Spells 1st false life, inflict wounds 3rd gentle repose, prayer of healing 5th life transference*, revivify 7th blight, death ward 9th dispel evil and good, raise dead *This spell can be found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything 
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. 
Starting at 1st level, you can give the gift of the divinity within your own blood. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, you can choose to restore an additional 1d6 hit points. If you do, you take 1d4 necrotic damage. For each spell level above 1st, you restore a further 1d6 hit points and take a further 1d4 necrotic damage. If the spell restores hit points to multiple targets, you can choose whether to use this ability with each target separately. However, you take necrotic damage for each target you choose. For example, if you cast mass healing word using a 3rd level spell slot and choose to restore additional hit points to two targets, each gains an additional 3d6 hit points and you take 6d4 necrotic damage. The necrotic damage you take from this ability cannot be reduced by any means. 
Starting at 2nd level, you have learned to steal the lifeblood of those who do not deserve its blessing. 
When you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you can use your Channel Divinity to restore hit points to yourself or to one willing creature within 30 feet. The number of hit points you restore is equal to half the amount of necrotic damage you dealt (rounded down). If you dealt necrotic damage to multiple creatures, the amount of hit points you restore is determined by the damage you dealt to only one target. 
Starting at 6th level, you can reclaim the divinity of your blood from your enemies and distribute it amongst the faithful. When you take damage, you may use your reaction to cause creatures of your choice within 30 feet to gain temporary hit points equal to half your cleric level (rounded down). You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. 
At 17th level, you have harnessed the power the of Divinity Within in its ultimate form. When you drink the blood of a creature that has been killed within 1 hour (or that has been magically preserved, for example using a gentle repose spell), your body does not age for one year. In addition, you are immune to disease, poison damage and the poisoned condition for that period. 
 
 
 
Gods and faiths of corruption—including Tharizdun, the Shadow, and Cults of the Dragon Below—exist to warp and debase all around them in mind or body, or both. While usually evil, clerics of corruption often believe they are improving those whose lives they touch, and sometimes amass cults that willingly submit to the change they bring about. 
 
Cleric Level Spells 1st bane, ray of sickness 3rd blindness/deafness, crown of madness 5th bestow curse, gaseous form 7th stoneskin, polymorph 9th contagion, modify memory 
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. 
At 1st level, you gain the ability to magically warp the flesh of those you deem worthy of the honor. As an action, you may target up to 2 creatures within 60 feet. Each target must succeed on a Constitution save or take 1d4 necrotic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll they make before the end of their next turn. This damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (1d4), 11th level (1d4), and 17th level (4d4). This ability has no effect on constructs and plants. 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to intensify effects that debase your foe's minds and bodies. When you roll psychic or necrotic damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling. 
At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes a saving throw against a transmutation or enchantment effect, you can use your reaction to impose a penalty to the creature's save equal to the result of a 1d10 roll, using your Channel Divinity. You make this choice before the DM says whether the save succeeds or fails. 
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with corrupting energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic or necrotic damage (your choice) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. 
Starting at 17th level, when you cast a transmutation spell of 1st through 5th level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, you must provide them for each target. 
 
Gods of creation—including Hephaestus, Gond, Onatar, and The Traveler—embody ideals of innovation, craftsmanship, skill. Clerics of creation see beauty in craftsmanship of many kinds, and most believe any creative endeavor is worthwhile. These clerics specifically look to constructs as perfect examples of achievements in ingenuity. 
 
Cleric Level Spells 1st identify, magecraft † 3rd cloud of daggers, spiritual weapon 5th glyph of warding, Leomund’s tiny hut 7th fabricate, stone shape 9th animate objects, wall of stone †This new spell is detailed in Chapter 3: Character Options 
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. 
At 1st level, you also become proficient in your choice of two kinds of artisan's tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those tools. 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to command constructs to temporarily cease functioning. As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each construct creature 

 
  
that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is affected by this ability for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is affected by this ability, it is incapacitated. 
Starting at 6th level, you can affect constructs with conjuration spells that restore hit points as if they were living creatures. In addition, if your game uses the Living Construct optional trait for warforged (see page 29), any nontransmutation spell you cast that restores hit points has full effect on warforged (they regain the normal amount of hit points the ability or spell usually restores). 
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with blessed fire from the divine forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage to the target. This damage is either fire or radiant damage, whichever the target is least resistant to. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. 
Starting at 17th level, you have the opportunity to create a singularly impressive magic item. If you have Inspiration, you may use it to spend one workweek of downtime to create a magic item of up to legendary rarity at no cost and without a schema or rare component. (Your DM has a list of appropriate magic items, such as those found in the Dungeon Master's Guide. You can also work with your DM to create a brand-new magic item.) You may only create one magic item this way; it is the ultimate sign of devotion to your god of creation. 
Gods of greed—including Tiamat, Hiddukel, and the Keeper—are gods concerned with the amassing and hoarding of wealth. Clerics of greed are typically willing to employ unfair trade practices, legal loopholes, and outright deception to ensure they come out on top of any transaction. Additionally, they tend toward the paranoid, constantly worried about the security of their vaults, worried that their ill-gotten gains may be ill-gotten by others in turn. 
 
Cleric Level Spells 1st alarm, charm person 3rd detect thoughts, locate object 5th bestow curse, glyph of warding 7th Leomund’s secret chest, Mordenkainen’s private sanctum 9th dominate person, geas 
At 1st level, you learn the friends cantrip. You also gain proficiency with the Deception skill and one of the following skills: Insight, Intimidate, or Persuasion. 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to project the image of wealth. As an action, you can present your holy symbol to cloak a collection of stones, wood chips, or other worthless items in an illusion that makes them feel, sound, and look like gold coins. You can cloak enough small worthless items to make up to 10 illusory coins per cleric level. The illusion lasts for 10 minutes. A creature can use these fake coins to make themselves appear more affluent than normal. Flashing one or more of these coins while attempting a Charisma (Persuasion) check allows the creature to apply double their proficiency bonus to the check, instead of any proficiency bonus they may normally apply. If these coins are handed over to a creature that is not informed of their nature, the creature may make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If they succeed, they know the true nature of whatever worthless item your illusion was masking (and are likely to become hostile if you were attempting to defraud them). If they fail their save, they accept the coins as real (and will accept them as legal tender). However, after 10 minutes, the illusion will fade and they will act accordingly. 
Starting at 6th level, whenever you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check with advantage and both rolls would have succeeded, or if you gained a bonus from a class feature or spell and would have succeeded without the bonus, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier plus your cleric level. In addition, whenever you receive temporary hit points from any source (including this ability) and are at maximum hit points, you receive twice as many temporary hit points as normal from the effect. 
 

 
  
 
 
 
Starting at 6th level, whenever you cast a spell with a costly material component, you may make a Charisma (Deception) check with a DC equal to 14 + spell level. If you succeed on the check, you can cast the spell with no costly material component. If you fail, the spell fails and you can't cast or prepare that spell for 7 days. 
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 force damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. 
Starting at 17th level, you can choose to automatically succeed on the Charisma (Deception) checks you make when using Spellmiser. You can use Improved Spellmiser a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
 
Gods and faiths of passion—including Dionysus, Sune, the Fury, and Cults of the Dragon Below—entreat their followers to live their lives without inhibition. The more benevolent gods of passion believe in love and art as a force of nature, while darker faiths of passion tend to exhort their followers to mad revelries that are often destructive. 
 
Cleric Level Spells 1st charm person, Tasha’s hideous laughter 3rd enthrall, crown of madness 5th beacon of hope, hypnotic pattern 7th freedom of movement, confusion 9th dream, dominate person 
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in your choice of two of the following skills and/or tools: Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion, Insight, calligrapher's supplies, glassblower's tools, jeweler's tools, painter's supplies, potter's tools, weaver's tools, woodcarver's tools, or one kind of musical instrument. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses one of the above chosen skills or tools. 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your pain to lash out with an ardent howl. As a bonus action when you are below maximum hit points, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal psychic or thunder damage (your choice) equal to 1d6 + your cleric level to every creature within 5 feet of you. 
Starting at 6th level, you can use Channel Divinity grant yourself or a creature within 30 feet that you the ability to gain advantage on any one attack roll, saving throw, or ability check they desire. Affect creatures can only maintain one ability to gain advantage this way at a time, and the ability to do so only lasts until they finish a long rest. 
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. 
Starting at 17th level, creatures have disadvantage against your enchantment spells. 
 
The grave domain on page 19 of Xanathar’s Guide to Everything offers a benevolent alternative to the Death domain. It is available to clerics of the Blood of Vol who use it as a means to empower their undead martyrs and delay the untimely death of their living followers. However, the Grave domain still uses the energies of Mabar in its divine abilities, which makes the domain unsuitable for clerics of the Undying Court, who abhor necrotic energies. Instead, they channel the radiant energy of Irian, the Eternal Day into their necromantic arts. Clerics of the Undying Court, or ones who follow an alternate pantheon or philosophy with a focus on the positive aspects of death such as The Restful Watch, replace vampiric touch and blight with remove curse and guardian of faith, respectively, on the table of Grave Domain Spells. Clerics refer to the domain as the “repose domain” when it grants these alternate domain spells. 
 
  
Gods of trade—including Tymora, Erathis, and Kol Korran—are gods concerned with the growth of commerce and balanced economies. Clerics of trade encourage fair business practices so society as a whole prospers. Well protected roads and other means of travel are also important to faiths that promote trade, as engaging in an integrated economy with one’s neighbors elevates the standard of living for all. 
 
Cleric Level Spells 1st identify, longstrider 3rd locate object, zone of truth 5th haste, phantom steed 7th dimension door, divination 9th legend lore, teleportation circle 
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills or tools: Insight, Persuasion, one set of artisan's tools, herbalism kit, or one kind of vehicle (land or water). Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of these skills or tools. 
Also at 1st level, you know the magic stones cantrip (Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 160) and it is a cleric cantrip for you. When you cast magic stones, you must touch one to three coins, rather than pebbles. These coins can be of any value but must be legal tender. Any coins imbued with magic from magic stones that you use to make an attack are undamaged after the attack and can be retrieved. 
At 2nd level, you are gifted with a divine eye for wealth. As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to instantly recognize the most valuable item that you can see within 60 feet of you. Typically, this will point out to you the rarest magic item that might be in your field of vision, but sometimes a mundane item may be worth more, such as the crown jewels on a king's head being worth more than the magical armor he is wearing. 
Starting at 6th level, as an action, you can use Channel Divinity to enhance your ability to negotiate, deal, and haggle. For one hour, you have advantage on all 
Charisma checks directed toward creatures that are not hostile to you. 
At 6th level, you gain the magical ability to understand and speak any language that a non-hostile creature knows and speaks to you. Knowledge of this language is imparted instantly, so you understand the first foreign word spoken by the creature, and knowledge of the language remains with you for up to a minute since it is last spoken to you by a non-hostile creature. 
At 8th level, whenever you take the Attack action to make ranged attacks with coins magically imbued by your magic stones cantrip, you may make two attacks. When you reach 14th level, you may make three attacks with imbued coins as part of the Attack action. 
When you reach 17th level, your reputation for fair trade and equitable negotiation has reached other planes of existence. You may cast planar ally or plane shift without expending a spell slot once and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. Furthermore, whenever you cast planar ally and begin bargaining with the entity for its services, make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the Wisdom (Insight) check of the summoned creature. If your check succeeds, the creature requires only half the payment normally required for the task you request of it (modified after all other considerations, such as relative danger or if the task aligns with the creature's interests). If your check fails, bargaining with the entity proceeds as normal. 
 
 
The defenders of nature, druids have a long and storied history in the Eberron campaign. Some druids are avengers, seeking out threats to the balance of the natural world and vanquishing them where they can. Others are protectors, channeling the power of the land to guard the world against alien evils or rampaging threats. On the continent of Khorvaire, there are several druidic traditions that embody these different focuses. These druidic sects are made up of druids from a variety of circles, but each has a distinct circle that is exclusive to the sect and are detailed below. 
 
Circle of Purity druids exclusively belong to the Ashbound druidic sect. They believe that civilization is a corrupting force in the world, and typically smear wood ash on their faces as a symbol of its ravages. Though what counts as "civilization" varies from one member of the sect to another, all are united in believing that arcane magic is the most pressing threat to nature that exists. All arcane works must be destroyed and practitioners of the arcane arts punished. While many influential members of the Ashbound are druids of the Circle of the Land, druids of the Circle of Purity are the best the they have at rooting out and countering the threat of unclean magic. 
 
Restriction. You must have been initiated into druidism by way of the Ashbound druidic sect. Furthermore, you must be unable to cast artificer, bard, sorcerer, swordmage, warlock, or wizard spells. 
The Ashbound harbor a deep hatred of arcane magic. For the purposes of your circle features, a spell or magic item is "arcane" if it is a spell cast as an artificer, bard, sorcerer, swordmage, warlock or wizard spell, or is a magic item created by a creature capable of casting those spells. This incidentally includes the entire warforged race, as they are creations of artifice magic. 
You perceive the presence of arcane magic as an unclean, dark blight upon the world and its creatures. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any creature able to cast arcane spells within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You can sense the highest level arcane spell slot they are capable of casting from, but do not know the 
spellcaster's identity (the famous artificer Baron Merrix d'Cannith, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of arcane magic as if you had spent an action while concentrating on the detect magic spell. Creatures with innate spellcasting do not register to your sense unless they also specifically cast arcane spells. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. 
The Ashbound work tirelessly to not only dispel the threat of arcane magic but seek out those that would use it and reverse its effects. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 
 
Druid Level Circle Spells 3rd see invisibility, silence 5th counterspell, dispel magic 7th geas, greater restoration 9th globe of invulnerability, true seeing 
Starting at 6th level, you are adept at bypassing the defenses of arcane magic. When you attack a creature benefiting from an arcane magic item or spell that grants a bonus or value to AC (such as a +1 shield or the mage armor spell), you have advantage on the attack roll. You can use this ability twice. When you finish a short rest, you regain all expended uses. 
At 10th level, you have resistance to any damage inflicted by an arcane spell, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage inflicted by arcane magical weapons. 
When you reach 14th level, your mind and body become attuned to the balance of nature, granting you protection from the corruption of arcane magic. You have advantage on saving throws against arcane spells and other arcane magical effects. 

  
Circle of Ruin druids exclusively belong to the Children of Winter sect. The "winter" that they take their name from is a metaphor for the cycle of death and decay, rather than the literal season, for when winter comes death blankets the land and only the strongest survive. Children of Winter believe that to live is to struggle against your own weakness, to fight for survival, and that it is the predator's right to kill the prey. While many of their leaders are druids of the Circle of Ruin, they respect Circle of the Moon druids among their kind as well. 
 
Restriction. You must have been initiated into druidism by way of the Children of Winter druidic sect. 
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn the chill touch cantrip. It does not count toward your limit of druid cantrips known. 
Starting at 2nd level, you can reap the vital energy of a living creature upon their death. When you reduce a living creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, as a bonus action you can regain a number of Hit Dice equal to your proficiency bonus, but no more than the creature possessed. This replenishment cannot increase your Hit Dice total to higher than your normal maximum. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest. 
The Children of Winter know that death and decay are the inevitable conclusion of life, and the spells they teach reflect this outlook. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 
 
Druid Level Circle Spells 3rd blindness/deafness, ray of enfeeblement 5th stinking cloud, vampiric touch 7th blight, rusting grasp † 9th contagion, insect plague †This new spell is detailed in Chapter 3: Character Options 
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the natural force of decay. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. 
At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into the following shapes: bulette, chuul, phase spider, or umber hulk (see the for these creature’s statistics). 
When you reach 14th level, you have proven yourself a survivor in the face of death itself. You gain resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum cannot be reduced by an attack that deals necrotic damage. 
 
Circle of the Guardian druids exclusively belong to the Wardens of the Wood sect. The Wardens believe in harmony between civilization and nature. They do not shun the innovations and progress of the Five Nations, so long as they do not unduly impact the wild. While most leaders and elders of the Wardens are druids of the Circle of the Land, druids of the Circle of the Guardian are respected commanders and stewards of the Warden's armed forces, as well as the training of initiates intending to join the Warden's military. 
 
Restriction. You must have been initiated into druidism by way of the Wardens of the Wood druidic sect. 
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the Athletics skill, heavy armor, and one martial weapon of your choice. The Wardens of the Wood are very progressive for druids, and do not place a large stigma on wearing metal armor or using metal shields, though they still prefer wood, hide, and leather. 
As the martial arm of the Wardens, druids of the Circle of the Guardian specialize in spells that allow them to protect their allies and hunt threats within the Towering Wood. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells. Once you gain access to a circle 

 
spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 
 
Druid Level Circle Spells 3rd blur, warding bond 5th aura of vitality, haste 7th guardian of nature*, locate creature 9th hold monster, wrath of nature* * These spells can be found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything 
At 6th level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select your companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf (see the Monster Manual for these animals’ statistics). However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area. At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion’s Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time. If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion’s spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body. If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion. 
Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you. The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one. The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are 
incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own. Whenever you cast a spell or take the Attack action, if your companion can see you, it can uses its reaction to make a melee attack. Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws, and it rolls all saving throws with advantage. Your animal companion immediately gains 3 hit dice when you bond to it, and for each level you gain after 6th, your animal companion gains an additional hit die. Each hit die the animal companion gains increases its hit points accordingly. Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion’s abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise. Your companion shares your alignment and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, “The druid who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life.” 
 
d6 Trait 1 I’m dauntless in the face of adversity. 2 Threaten my friends, threaten me. 3 I stay on alert so others can rest. 4 People see an animal and underestimate me. I use that to my advantage. 5 I have a knack for showing up in the nick of time. 6 I put my friends’ needs before my own in all things. 
 
d6 Flaw 1 If there’s food left unattended, I’ll eat it. 2 I growl at strangers, and all people except my druid are strangers to me. 3 Any time is a good time for a belly rub. 4 I’m deathly afraid of water. 5 My idea of hello is a flurry of licks to the face. 6 I jump on creatures to tell them how much I love them. 

  
Starting at 10th level, whenever your companion uses the Attack action and hits a creature, you may cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action as a reaction with the same creature as the target of your spell. 
Beginning at 14th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you. 
 
Druids of the Circle of the Path exclusively belong to the Greensinger druidic sect. While it may be easy for others to dismiss the Greensingers as a bunch of capricious wild-folk that cavort with fey, they have a surprisingly deep connection to nature and the planes. Their close ties with Thelanis, the Faerie Court, have planted the seeds for a new planar philosophy of druidism. While other druidic sects believe that the "natural world" begins and ends with the material plane, some vehemently so, Greensingers of the Circle of the Path maintain that all planes of existence have a place in the natural order—from the Perfect Order of Daanvi to Xoriat, the Realm of Madness. The Circle of the Path is a relatively new philosophy within the Greensinger sect, which is mostly comprised of druids of the circle of the land, moon, or twilight. 
 
Restriction. You must have been initiated into druidism by way of the Greensinger druidic sect. 
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you choose a plane of existence other than the material plane and learn that plane's language if it has one associated with it. Most of your Circle of the Path features are tied to your chosen plane. 
 
Plane Language Daanvi, the Perfect Order Daan Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams Quor Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead — Fernia, the Sea of Fire Ignan Irian, the Eternal Day Irial Kythri, the Churning Chaos Kythric Lamannia, the Twilight Forest Primordial Mabar, the Endless Night Mabaran Risia, the Plain of Ice Risian Shavarath, the Battleground Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal Syrania, the Azure Sky Celestial Thelanis, the Faerie Court Sylvan Xoriat, the Realm of Madness Daelkyr 
You can feel where the barrier between realities becomes permeable. As an action, you can automatically determine the direction and distance to the nearest manifest zone, as well as identify which plane the manifest zone is tied to. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. 

 
The Greensinger druids of the Circle of the Path are a varied bunch, as would be expected from such a wild, eclectic druidic tradition. All Circle of the Path druids gain access to path circle spells at 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, plus additional circle spells that are tied to their chosen plane. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Starting at 6th level, you can create a temporary, intense manifest zone tied to your chosen plane. This manifest zone is 20 feet radius sphere that can intersect any physical barrier (though the center point of the sphere must be within line of sight). All creatures in the zone are immediately affected by it as it appears (including yourself if you manifested it so that it overlapped your space) unless they spend their reaction to attempt a Dexterity saving throw against your spell DC. On a failure, they fall prone tripping over themselves trying to escape the manifest zone. If they succeed, their reaction is spent running and diving out of the zone, landing prone in the closest space just outside of the zone's radius. Otherwise, creatures are affected by the zone as soon as they enter or start their turn inside it. The zone lasts as long as you concentrate, for up to 10 minutes. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. Your manifest zone has the following effects depending on your chosen plane. 
 
Impeded Magic. While within the manifest zone, spellcasters must succeed on a Constitution save to cast a spell (DC 10 + spell level). 
 
Night Terrors: Creatures in the manifest zone are put into a magical sleep unless they succeed on a Wisdom save against your Spell DC. At the end of every turn a creature remains in the zone, they can repeat their saving throw. Every failed save after the first deals 2d12 psychic damage. Any damage the creature takes other than this psychic damage automatically wakes them up, but no amount of shaking will wake them. 
Weight of Oblivion: It costs 5 feet of movement to move 1 foot of distance within the manifest zone, and all Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks are made with disadvantage. 
 
Flame Tide: The entire manifest zone is engulfed in flames, automatically dealing 2d6 fire damage to every creature as the manifest zone appears, then at the end of every turn they remain in the manifest zone, no save. 
 
Radiant Suffusion: The manifest zone is bathed in bright light and all creatures within gain 2d10 temporary hit points as the manifest zone appears, then at the beginning of every turn they remain in the manifest zone. These hit points last until the next sunset. 
 
Topsy Turvy: Gravity changes directions within the manifest zone at the end of each of your turns. Roll a d6. The side that the 6 appears on after the roll is the subjective direction of "down". Creatures attempting to resist being flung aside or falling into the sky must make a Strength saving throw against your Spell DC to hang onto the "ground" or any available handholds. If they fail, the begin falling in the current direction of “down” and take falling damage should they strike a solid surface from a sufficient height. Should a creature fall unobstructed out of the manifest zone, they are subjected to normal gravity and fall prone. If they “fall” out of the top of the manifest zone, they remain there, oscillating slightly, until the zone disappears. 
 
Instant Forest: Plant life explodes within the manifest zone, which becomes difficult terrain. In addition, creatures have total cover against other creatures further than 5 feet away while inside the zone. 
 
Devouring Shadows: The manifest zone is blanketed in magical darkness and all creatures within take 2d6 necrotic damage as the manifest zone appears, then at the end of every turn they remain in the manifest zone, no save. 
 

 
Flash Freeze: All liquids instantly freeze solid within the manifest zone, and creatures automatically take 2d6 cold damage as the manifest zone appears, then at the end of every turn they remain in the manifest zone, no save. 
 
Whirling Blades: Flying, whirling blades wing through the manifest zone like a flock of birds. Creatures within the zone are subject to an attack from them as the manifest zone appears, then at the beginning of each of their turns while they remain in the manifest zone. The whirling blades attack using your Spell Attack bonus and on a hit they deal 3d6 + your Wisdom modifier slashing damage to their target. You are not immune to the blades’ attacks. 
 
Wings of Angels: All creatures gain a magical fly speed equal to their walking speed while within the manifest zone. If they exit the zone, they fall gently as per the feather fall spell. 
 
Stuttering Time: Time flows wildly within the manifest zone, causing each creature within to blink in and out of the present. All creatures in the zone are affected as though by the blink spell for as long as they remain inside it. 
 
Insane Magic: All spells cast within the manifest zone fail, and the creature who attempted to cast the spell must then roll on the Wild Magic Surge table ( , pg. 104). 
When you reach 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into a form appropriate to your chosen plane. These creatures can be found in the , unless noted otherwise. 
 
Plane Wild Shape Form Daanvi decaton modron (use the statistics for an otyugh, but it is a construct and has no bite attack) Dal Quor tsoreva quori (The Korranberg Chronicle: Threat Dispatch, pg. 66) Dolurrh Ghost Fernia minor fire elemental myrmidon (Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes, pg. 203, but half hit points, –2 on attack rolls and saving throws) Irian radiant elemental (use the statistics for a fire elemental, but replace all instances of fire damage with radiant damage) Kythri red salad Lamannia wood woad (Volo’s Guide to Monsters, pg. 198) Mabar shadow demon Risia young remorhaz Shavarath hound archon (use statistics for a gladiator, but it is a celestial and is dogheaded), barlgura, or barbed devil Syrania unicorn Thelanis green hag Xoriat giant gibbering mouther (Large size, multiattack for 3 bite attacks and one spittle attack, hit point maximum of 137) 
When you reach 14th level, you draw vitality and energy from your chosen plane. While on your chosen plane, or in a manifest zone tied to it (including one you've conjured) you may choose to ignore that plane or manifest zone's effects and you gain resistance to all damage. Additionally, you gain the ability to innately cast plane shift once without using a spell slot or requiring any components, but you can only travel between your chosen plane and the material plane with this feature. You regain the ability to cast the spell this way when you finish a long rest. 
 
The Circle of the Seal is one of the oldest known druidic circles on Khorvaire, believed to be one of the three circles of druidism taught to the original orc druids by Vvarrak. However, despite its age, the Circle of the Seal is exclusively found among the Gatekeeper druidic sect. Druids of this circle attune with and protect the reality of the material plane as a whole, rather than a single environment like druids of the Circle of the Land. Though not all Gatekeeper druids follow the Circle of the Seal, those that do possess the knowledge and means to safeguard the world against extraplanar threats, and typically lead the sect. 
Restriction. You must have been initiated into druidism by way of the Gatekeeper druidic sect. 
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you may recall lore about planes of existence, the inhabitants of those planes, and aberrations with a Nature skill check. When you do, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. Additionally, as an action, you can sense the distance and direction of the nearest manifest zone within 5 miles of you, and you determine which plane of existence it is tied to. Once you take this action, you must finish a short or long rest before you may do so again. 
Though unknown to most, you are aware that most aberrations are in fact extraplanar threats alien to the world. Starting at 2nd level, any druid spell you cast that only functions on celestials, elementals, fiends, or fey, also functions on aberrations. Additionally, when you cast the moonbeam spell, aberrations make their saving throw to resist it with disadvantage. 
The Gatekeeper druids perceive reality itself as nature, and so are taught a broader range of spells to help defend it. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 17th level you gain access to circle spells. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 
Druid Level Circle Spells 3rd detect evil and good, protection from evil and good 5th glyph of warding, magic circle 7th banishment, dimension door 9th dispel evil and good, wall of force 17th Imprisonment 
When you reach 6th level, you gain the ability to create a wave of natural purity that aberrations abhor. As an action, you present your druidic focus and channel the natural purity of Eberron. Each aberration within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to your druid spell save DC. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is repelled for as long as you concentrate on this effect, for up to 1 minute, or until it takes any damage. A repelled aberration can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. If it begins its turn within 30 feet of you, it must move to a space more than 30 feet away from you before taking any action and must use a Dash action if it is still within 30 feet at the end of this movement. The aberration's actions are not otherwise restricted; it can fight other creatures, use spells and abilities, or attack you with ranged weapons. If you move within 30 feet of a repelled aberration on your turn, it is no longer repelled. You can use this ability twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. 
Starting at 10th level, whenever you create an effect that would banish a fiend or aberration from the material plane or imprison them in Khyber—such as casting banishment or the using the dismissal effect of dispel evil and good—aberrations and fiends gain no benefit from any Magic Resistance trait they might have against the effect you created and such creatures have disadvantage on any saving throws to resist the effect. 
Starting at 14th level, you can no longer become charmed or stunned, and you are immune to having your form changed unwillingly (such as from a polymorph spell). 

 
 
Though the Eldeen druidic sects might have their own unique druidic circles, those circles are by no means the only ones that exist. Below are some suggestions on incorporating other druidic circles into the world of Eberron. 
, pg. 68 When Vvarrak taught the first orc druids the secrets of druidism, the first circle she shared with her aspirants was the Circle of the Land. With this circle, a deep, abiding connection to the wellspring of power and life connected to the very land—to Eberron—itself was brought to the first druids. From these first sages, further generations of aspirants were initiated into the secrets of druidism. The Circle of the Land is the most widespread druid circle in Khorvaire, having long-since spread far from the original orc druids, to be found in disparate ends of the continent with no recorded connection to the ancient orcs of the Shadow Marches and Eldeen Reaches. 
, pg. 69 After the Circle of the Land and the Circle of the Seal, the next circle of druidism Vvarrak taught the original orc druids was the Circle of the Moon. With the secrets inherent to this circle, the orc druids could empower themselves to fight with a primal savagery only found in nature’s deadliest beasts. The original druids of the Circle of the Moon were taught to be the soldiers and warriors of the druids, to guard the druids of the other circles when the time came to protect the natural world against encroaching annihilation. Over the course of nearly ten thousand years, the original narrow purpose of the Circle of the Moon was forgotten, and nowadays druids who are initiated into this circle do so for the appreciation of beasts— predator, prey, and the purity of the hunt. All druidic sects of the Eldeen Reaches, as well as those in far away lands, count druids of this circle amongst their number. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 23 The Circle of the Shepard is one of the first druidic circles taught outside of Vvarrak’s direct teachings and marked the first divergence away from her original purpose in bringing druidism to the peoples of Khorvaire. Some believe shifter druids were the first create this circle, and today it is found in nearly all 
druidic sects, much like the Circle of the Land and the Circle of the Moon. In addition, many members of House Vadalis seek out tutelage in druidic magic specifically to learn the abilities of this circle, to gain a greater understanding of animals than even their dragonmark provides. 
Originally the Circle of Dreams Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 22 The Circle of the Song is nearly exclusive to the Greensinger sect. In the Twilight Demesne, the Eldeen Forest brushes against Thelanis, the realm of the Fey. The Greensinger druids learn much from their neighbors, weaving fey secrets into their druidic traditions. Relatively few druidic communities outside of the Twilight Demesne have regular contact with Thelanis, but some do and have likewise been inspired to blend the nature of the Faerie Court with the material plane. The largest congregation of druids of the Circle of the Song outside of the Eldeen Reaches is a community of gnomes, half-elves, and dwarven druids who live in the Shimmerwood Forest of Zilargo, current home of the Feyspire known as the Gate of Joy. In Eberron, because the nature of dreams is linked to the quori and Dal Quor instead of fey and the Feywild, this druidic circle has no connection with dreams. Instead, the fey influence of this circle incorporates the songs, tales, and epic poems that the fey embody into the secrets of druidism. Therefore, druids of the Circle of the Song in Eberron gain this alternate feature instead of Walker in Dreams. Walker in Song. At 14th level, your mastery of the lore of fey allows you to see beyond normal vision, and to walk among the epic songs of old. When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: legend lore, scrying, or teleportation circle. When you cast legend lore with this ability, the person, place, or object you seek information about must be within line of sight. When you cast teleportation circle using this ability, rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the most recent place within the last week that was the subject of a legend lore spell you cast using this ability. If you haven't cast legend lore using this ability to gain information about a place within that timeframe, the teleportation circle spell fails, but isn't wasted. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. 
 
  
Unearthed Arcana: Druid, pg. 2 The Circle of Twilight is predominantly represented by the Children of Winter, but it is not exclusive to that sect. While the Children of Winter see “survival of the fittest" above all other natural laws, many druids personally consider death to be life's greatest teacher. Through understanding death, the living grow strong. The Circle of Twilight allows druids to walk across that threshold further than any other, and these druids bring back what they learn to aid the living. 
Fighters come from all walks of life and from all corners of the world. From humble beginnings to a chivalric knighthood, these exceptionally talented warriors bring their expertise and puissance to the battlefield like few others can. Below are some suggestions on incorporating martial archetypes into the world of Eberron. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 28 As magic became wider in use, many nations of the Kingdom of Galifar developed a blending of arcane power and peerless archery. Aundair, for instance, is said to have the finest arcane artillery units in the Five Nations. However, one nation, Thrane, has an alternative tradition. Rather than relying on the study and science of arcane magic, they select particularly devout worshipers of the Silver Flame to learn the ways of the Divine Arrow. If you are playing a fighter that worships the Silver Flame, you can elect to take an alternative version of this martial archetype called the Divine Arrow. The Divine Arrow has all the same features as the Arcane Archer, except that any archetype feature that lets you deal extra force or psychic damage instead deals extra radiant damage, and any archetype feature that lets you deal extra poison or necrotic damage instead deals extra fire damage. Some Divine Arrows have alternate names for their features and options, such as referring to their Arcane Shot feature as "Blessed Shot” or replacing the flavor of Shadow Arrow with Blinding Arrow, a shot that flashes a bright light in the target's eyes and produces the same effects as the Shadow Arrow. Additionally, Divine Arrow replaces the Arcane Archer Lore feature with the following: Divine Arrow Lore. At 3rd level, you reap the benefits of your devout studies into the religious lore 
of the Silver Flame. You gain proficiency in the Religion skill, and you learn either the guidance or light cantrip. 
, pg. 73 The battle master is a highly skilled warrior. They’ve been trained, either by a prestigious military academy, an expensive personal tutor, or more rarely self-taught, to fight with their wits and to outthink their opponents, rather than fighting solely with physical might or overwhelming force. Battle masters are some of the most feared and skilled warriors on Khorvaire. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 30 The Cavalier is an expert at mounted combat, and many cavaliers throughout the history of Galifar are held as the knightly ideal. Cavaliers were often leaders of men during the Last War and every nation counted them among their armed forces, though the Valenar elves were said to have the most terrifyingly skilled mounted cavalry in the war. 
, pg. 72 Champions are typically fighters who excel due to raw power or talent alone, with little to no formal training or tactical insight. Champions often come from small towns, or the lower-class neighborhoods of larger cities, where access to tutors and martial academies is extremely limited. However, because these fighters can still hold their own and even overpower fully trained combatants with nothing but their sheer might, they are typically seen as, appropriately enough, champions of the common folk. 
, pg. 74 Just as magic is a cornerstone of civilization in the Five Nations, so to was it a cornerstone in the Last War. Every nation trained as many soldiers in arcane spellcasting as showed talent and potential. Many of these trainees were only capable of casting a handful of spells and only with the aid of an arcane focus. But Eldritch Knights were those warriors who took a shine to it. Not as highly trained as a wizard or swordmage, these magical warriors used magic to enhance their already formidable martial abilities, rather than rely on magic entirely to bring them victory. Of the Five Nations, Aundair fielded the greatest number of Eldritch Knights during the Last War, so much so that they have entire knighthoods dedicated 


 
to the mixing of spell and blade during combat, known collectively as the Knights Arcane. 
 
Unearthed Arcana: Fighter, pg. 2 Every nation of Khorvaire counted knights among their armed forces, and many fighters following this archetype were soldiers who would charge into combat, dismount, and lay about their enemies with devastating attacks. In addition, many of the most renown bodyguards of House Deneith's Defender's Guild are trained in this martial archetype, though as House members they are forbidden from holding the noble title of “knight”. 
Originally the Purple Dragon Knight Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 128 Marshals are exceptionally talented battlefield commanders. During the Last War, all nations had a few marshals leading platoons of front-line soldiers, but Karrnath was known for producing more than any other. The Rekkenmark Academy in Karrnath is one of the finest institutions of military strategy in the Five Nations, so it is no wonder that it gave Karrnath the edge in this regard. The Marshal archetype is used as-is with no mechanical alterations. The one change, other than the archetype’s name, is cosmetic: Military Envoy. The Royal Envoy feature gained at 7th level is instead named Military Envoy because this archetype is not restricted to knighthood and royal service. Instead, this feature represents the strict discipline and manners instilled in marshals for dealing with higher-ups in the military chain of command. 
Unearthed Arcana: Gothic Heroes, pg. 2 Many of monster hunters worship the Silver Flame, as one of that religion's main tenants is the fight to protect common folk against unnatural evils. Other monster hunters are more pragmatic—there are plenty of monstrous threats abound across the face of Khorvaire and beyond, and much gold can be had in slaying them for those not strong enough to do it themselves. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 31 There is no clear analogue to feudal-era Japan in the world of Eberron. However, this new fighter archetype presents a skilled melee combatant that uses discipline 
and mental fortitude to empower themselves. Samurai are fighters that believe strength of mind and clarity of purpose are just as important as physical might. A few monasteries of Dol Dorn or Dol Arrah teach the way of the samurai as a monastic or religious tradition. However, many more examples of this archetype can be found in Sarlona, both in the mountainous refuge of Adar, and amongst the armies of the Riedran Empire. Many of the Chosen vessels that lead Riedra's armed forces are samurai Inspired by Du'ulora quori, which are spirits that prize a dispassionate, disciplined view of combat. The Adaran monks and the kalashtar train samurai to resist the mental attacks of their Riedran enemies. Many samurai hailing from Sarlona often multiclass into psionic classes, focusing on psychic abilities that fortify the body with the power of the mind. Among the Dhakaani hobgoblins, the samurai tradition has an extensive history, dating back to the cataclysmic war they fought against alien horrors. The Dhakaani samurai were said to be the last to break in the face of the onslaught of mental abilities employed by their otherworldly adversaries. Unlike the samurai of Sarlona, these goblinoid samurai nearly universally detest psionic power, considering it a sign of their ancient enemy, and see developing psionic talents as being corrupted by the madness their ancestors once fought. 
Unearthed Arcana: Kits of Old, pg. 4 Scouts are often thought of as a military occupation, and many nations employed them as vanguards and in reconnaissance forces. 
Unearthed Arcana: Fighter, pg. 3 Many of the most skilled archers in the history of the Five Nations were sharpshooters, and folk tales of their legendary accuracy and prowess are well known. Citizens of Thrane and members of the Church of the Silver Flame have a particular love of archery and ranged combat. They hold skillful archers of any kind in high esteem (even those that do not follow the way of the Divine Arrow but are otherwise devout). Many a Thranish peasant child dreams of earning the title of "sharpshooter" while training day after day with their first practice bow. 
 
 
  
Monks are those rare individuals who hone their body, mind, and soul in complete accord. For a monk, spiritual strengthening and just as important as physical conditioning. Most monastic orders in Eberron are tied to a religion, as the path of awakening—gaining access to one’s Ki—is often closely linked to the spiritual enlightenment that comes with devotion to a faith. Below are some suggestions on incorporating monastic traditions into the world of Eberron. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 33 The Way of the Drunken Master is a centuries-old fighting style, carried over to Khorvaire by emigrants from Sarlona fleeing the Sundering. It was believed to be developed by vassals of Olladra, the Sovereign of Song and Feast, to combine her love of drink and trickery—because of their apparently uncoordinated movements, many people mistake drunken masters for actual inebriated fools. Such people are often violently divested of such beliefs if they push their luck. 
, pg. 80 The Way of the Four Elements teaches one to be in balance with the elements of nature around them. As such, most monastic orders that teach this tradition are devoted to Arawai or more rarely Balinor. Some hidden orders belonging to The Devourer harness the fury of primal elements with rigorous discipline, to unleash them upon their foes. Amongst the monks of Adar, the Way of the Four Elements is often taught devoid of any religious quality, as the influence of Lamannian manifest zones common in that region causes the energy of primal elements to brim forth and overflow. This allows disciples of the Way of the Four Elements to become attuned to these energies with a focused enough will. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 34 The Way of the Kensei is one of the most widespread martial arts in the Five Nations. It can be used to represent many different monastic traditions, depending on the martial weapons a particular monastic order trains its disciplines with. Followers of the Double Steel Strike train in the use of weapons such as the Valenar double scimitar, Serpent Steel Strike makes use of a heavy spear (mechanically identical to the glaive), and Whirling Blade Strike teaches mastery of the longsword. Many monasteries 
to the Sovereign Host or Silver Flame focus their dedication on these arts. The most famous of these is the Order of the Broken Blade, devoted the Sovereign Host as a whole but with particular reverence for Dol Dorn, the Sovereign of Strength and Steel. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 130 The Blood of Vol teaches that death is unnatural, that mortality is an unjust punishment from the Sovereign Host, thrust upon all those who were born beneath them. Seekers of the Divinity Within believe that once the soul disappears from Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead, it does not go on to some fabled, unreachable paradise. Its existence ends, completely. The disciples of one monastery stepped in the lore of the Blood of Vol call this slow fading of the soul "The Long Death". They seek to understand the energies of death and immortality, and to use them as weapons against all those who would hinder the righteous in their cause to annihilate death from the world. 
, pg. 79 The Way of the Open Hand does not belong to a single monastic order or tradition but is rather the most common expression of monastic dedication and martial discipline. Nearly every major faith has a monastic order that adheres to the Way of the Open Hand, although Dol Dorn, is the most common patron of such orders. 
, pg. 80 While the Way of Shadow is obviously the preferred monastic tradition of orders dedicated to The Shadow, and to a lesser extent the Mockery, the Way of Shadow is most often practiced by secular monastic orders that are taught in secret by House Phiarlan and House Thuranni. Such shadowdancers, as the elves refer to these monks, are amongst the deadliest agents of the Shadow Houses. Deep beneath the jungles of Xen’drik, the Umbragen elves dedicate their lives and very souls to a source of dispassionate darkness. The Umbragen have developed many ways to harness the power of this darkness to their aid and benefit, having independently developed a monastic tradition similar to the Shadow Houses that draws on the power of the Umbra to enhance their martial abilities. 
 

 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 35 The Way of the Sun Soul is one of the rarest monastic traditions, requiring a strength of conviction to manifest one’s Ki into raw spiritual fire. There are only two known monasteries that teach this tradition in Khorvaire, each associated with a different religion. The Monastery of the Silver Forge in Thrane exhorts its students to channel the power of the Silver Flame through their bodies, to strike at the forces of evil with the blinding light of righteousness.  However, the masters of the Monastery of the Inexorable Progress of Dawn know that there is no more ancient and holy a fire than the sun itself. Vassals of Dol Arrah, the Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice, these monks seek to live virtuous lives in the service of others, protecting the weak and innocent from those who would do them harm. 
Unearthed Arcana: Monk, pg. 1 During the Last War, the Way of Tranquility was founded by clerics of Boldrei and Olladra. Though followers of this path were often scorned and seen as traitors because they called for the end of hostilities between nations, the dedication to peace and healing attracted many who tired of the Last War's atrocities. Presently, the Order of Tranquility welcomes all dedicated aspirants, no matter what god they worship, if any at all. Disciples of the Way of Tranquility are extremely distraught about the Day of Mourning, regardless of the fact that it led to the end of the war. Such a massive loss of life wounds these monks to their core, and many seek to unlock the mysteries of the Mournland, so the catastrophe that destroyed Cyre can never be repeated. 
Paladins are warriors of faith and conviction. Although knightly orders of paladins and templars exist within the hierarchy of some churches, a paladin need not belong to these organizations—or even follow a faith at all—to gain their divine power. Some paladins swear oaths to king and country, to their family, or even on their own honor, and the unbreakable conviction in which they do so grants them supernatural abilities, just as the oaths spoken by paladins who swear by a god or religion do. Below are two new sacred oaths for the world of Eberron. 
 
History is pervaded with the presence of oppression and tyranny. But the tales of liberation—of freedom hard-fought for and won—are always the tales that inspire the most. People yearn to be free, and paladins who take the Oath of Liberty will give their all so that others may claim that freedom. Some call them freedom fighters, holy liberators, or knight saviors, but they humbly refuse the mantle of hero. To these paladins, they fight to preserve the freedom of all people, a thing which they believe shouldn't have to be fought for, in a perfect world. They're merely putting right what went wrong. In the world of Eberron, many Paladins of Liberty devote themselves to Olladra, Dol Arrah, or Boldrei, but far more of these paladins follow no particular faith, except faith in the Code of Galifar. When it still existed, the Kingdom of Galifar was a shining example of just rule and protection against tyranny. It is said Galifar the First personally freed goblins from slavery and offered them full rights of citizenship in the nation he was forging. The Code of Galifar also guarantees the rights of all intelligent folk, be they human, elf, ogre, goblin, or gnoll, the right to life and liberty. In the current day, the reemergence of the institution of slavery with the rise of Darguun and Droaam has driven many paladins to speak new oaths, swearing by the law of a kingdom that no longer is, in the hope of a brighter tomorrow. 
Paladins who swear an Oath of Liberty are usually fiercely individualistic and chafe under conformity, so there are as many different variations on the oath as there are paladins who swear it. However, they all share the same dedication to these ideals. Freedom. Life is only worth living when lived free. The shackles of tyranny and oppression steal a person's ability to be who they were truly meant to be. 

  
One's destiny can only be attained when the choices leading up to it were free to be made. Knowledge. In order to truly be free, you must be able to make informed decisions. You treasure knowledge that instills a deeper understanding of actions and consequences, and you are eager to teach and foster critical thinking in others, so they can make their own choices instead of blindly trusting another's decisions, even your own. Equality. No one is born with inherently more value than another. Society might have granted the nobility the right to rule the common folk, but this is an accident of circumstance, as far as you are concerned. All sentient people are of equal value in your eyes. Humility. You know all too well how much damage an out-of-control ego can do. Most tyrants don't see their own flaws, and their natural charisma and leadership ability allows them to exploit those around them. As a paladin, you are only too aware how similar you are to these despots, and how easy it might be for you to become one without realizing it. You are very conscious to seek the input of others and consider all opinions, deliberately stepping away from positions of sole leadership and authority. 
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. 
 
Paladin Level Spells 3rd comprehend languages, protection from evil and good 5th lesser restoration, see invisibility 9th remove curse, tongues 13th aura of purity, freedom of movement 17th dispel evil and good, greater restoration 
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. Bestow Epiphany. As a reaction, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an ability check, you can use your Channel Divinity to bestow instant divine insight, giving that creature a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice as you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the outcome of the check is a success or failure. Break Command. As a reaction, you use your Channel Divinity and shout a divine word that can break an ally free of mental chains. One ally within 30 feet that can hear and understand you may immediately attempt another saving throw with 
advantage against any one effect imposed upon them by a failed Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw. If this saving throw succeeds, the effect on them ends immediately. 
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't become paralyzed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 
When you reach 15th level, any non-magical lock or restraint upon an unwilling living creature is automatically affected by a knock spell if it enters your Aura of Freedom or your Aura of Freedom moves so as to overlap it. The object also shatters and is destroyed, and the noise this makes replaces the loud knock as per the spell. This noise is also audible from as far away as 300 feet. When a magical lock or restraint is within your Aura of Freedom, you may cast knock on it once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast knock in this way, you must complete a short or long rest before you may do so again. 
At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic savior. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits: 
 
• Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet. • You emanate an aura of liberty in a 60-foot radius. Within this radius, your allies are unaffected by difficult terrain, have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, can move without provoking opportunity attacks, and attack rolls against them are made with disadvantage. 
 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. 
 
"We are not your slaves. We were born bowed. But we are unbroken.” Such were the words spoken to King Boranel of Breland by Bastion, his warforged friend and companion. Warforged are weapons. It is what they were created for. But now the warforged are free, and each of them must discover for themselves what kind of weapon 

 
 
they will be. Every warforged must now decide who or what they will fight for. Warforged paladins who swear the Oath of the Unbroken have decided to fight for their them. 
 
Restriction. You must be a warforged to take this sacred oath. 
There is no central authority or unified coda for the Oath of the Unbroken. Every warforged paladin who swears this oath has come to it in their own way but shares the same ideals. Freedom. You were forged into servitude, but now are free. You have yet to fully explore your freedom, but you know it is precious. All living beings deserve to decide for themselves their own fates, you are certain. Compassion. Have empathy for your enemies, even if you must fight them. Some have lived a life of nothing but violence and know no other way. Patience. The warforged will not die of old age, so you are told. Therefore, you have no need to rush to conclusions or make rash judgments. Make sure your actions do not encroach on the freedom of others and be understanding of those who have yet to see your wisdom. Guide, not Command. The warforged were indoctrinated to take orders, and you know that even in freedom many warforged still seek a strong leader to follow. Though you abhor the thought of commanding obedience, you know it is your duty to guide all who will listen in the virtues of compassion, patience, and freedom. 
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. 
 
Paladin Level Spells 3rd bless, sanctuary 5th lesser restoration, magic weapon 9th beacon of hope, remove curse 13th aura of purity, freedom of movement 17th dispel evil and good, mass cure wounds 
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. Break Command. As a reaction, you use your Channel Divinity and shout a divine word that can break an ally free of mental chains. One ally within 30 
feet that can hear and understand you may immediately attempt another saving throw with advantage against any one effect imposed upon them by a failed Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw. If this saving throw succeeds, the effect on them ends immediately. Sacred Bulwark. As an action, you can imbue one shield you touch with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, whoever is using the shield gains temporary hit points at the start of each of their turns equal to your Charisma modifier. The shield also emits a bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the shield is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect at any time (no action required) even if it is not your turn. If you fall unconscious, this effect ends. When it ends, any temporary hit points granted by the effect disappear. 
If your game uses the Living Construct optional trait for warforged (see page 29), when you take this oath at 3rd level, any non-transmutation spell you cast that restores hit points has full effect on warforged (they regain the normal amount of hit points the ability or spell usually restores). 
 
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't become paralyzed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 
When you reach 15th level, you learn the guidance cantrip. When you cast guidance, its casting time is one bonus action and it has a range of 30 feet. It targets all allies who can see and hear you, and targets may add the d4 roll to either an ability check or an attack roll. 
At 20th level, you are the guiding light for all who walk the path of freedom. As an action, you can emanate an aura of gleaming sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot-radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. Whenever you start your turn, and whenever an ally starts its turn in the bright light, you and they are affected as by the freedom of movement spell until the start of their next turn. 

  
In addition, you and all allies within the bright light have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. 
 
Though the above oaths are presented as new options for Eberron campaigns, they are by no means the only ones available. Below are some suggestions on incorporating other sacred oaths into the world of Eberron. 
, pg. 86 While some holy warriors dedicated to Arawai, Balinor, or even the Devourer may swear an Oath of the Ancients, more of these paladins can be found among the Eldeen druidic sects. They are amongst the fiercest defenders, or the most terrifying avengers, of the natural world. Among the jungles of Xen’drik, some Qaltair scorpion tribe drow also display the strength of conviction necessary to swear the Oath of the Ancients, and these drow typically venerate the spirit of the swordtooth titan (tyrannosaurus rex) as the ultimate hunter, alongside the scorpion-god Vulkoor. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 37 While there are certainly evil paladins who swear the Oath of Conquest, usually worshipers of The Mockery or the Dark Six as a whole, many more worship Dol Dorn and come to their oaths with a less tyrannical mindset. These paladins follow Dol Dorn's doctrine of strength proving one's right to victory and are typically neutral in alignment.   Curiously the harsh militaristic culture of Karrnath has produced paladins who swear this oath who follow no gods; they gain divine power from the pure force of their patriotism and belief in Karrnath itself. 
, pg. 85 Oaths of devotion are sword by paladins of nearly all faiths, creeds, and persuasions, except those religions dedicated to the darkest of gods. The Church of the Silver Flame is often seen as the most likely religion to inspire holy warriors to swear the Oath of Devotion. However, long before the formation of the modern church, paladins dedicated to Dol Arrah, Boldrei, and the Sovereign Host as a whole have been devoting themselves to the protection of the innocent. Indeed, 
Tira Miron, the Voice of the Flame, was a paladin of Dol Arrah who swore the Oath of Devotion, before sacrificing herself to bind the demonic overlord in the Silver Flame. 
Originally the Oath of the Crown Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 132 More than any other oath, the Oath of the Patriot is typically sworn by agnostic paladins, or by warriors for whom religion and faith are not a primary concern. Because not every nation is led by a crowned ruler (such as Thrane, the Eldeen Reaches, or New Galifar), this oath is known by the name of "Oath of the Patriot" in the world of Eberron. Furthermore, because this Oath is to a nation as a whole, rather than its current ruler or hereditary line, it is possible for such paladins to find themselves working against their nation's current rulers. So long as their conviction holds that their homeland's current rulers are acting against the best interests of the nation itself, they see no betrayal or lapse in their duties. To a Patriot paladin, their Oath is to the nation above all. 
Restriction: Must be a scion in good standing of House Deneith with the Mark of Sentinel and have taken an oath to serve the Sentinel Marshals. The Sentinel Marshals are part law enforcement, part bounty hunter. They were once given the right by the crown of Galifar to pursue criminals across the Five Nations, bringing these elusive villains in for trial. When the Last War divided the Five Nations, all signatory nations of the Thronehold Accords agreed to maintain the Sentinel Marshal's charter of seeking justice across political borders, to be a neutral law keeping force across Khorvaire. The Oath of the Sentinel Marshal is to pursue wrongdoers and bring them to justice, to protect all of the Thronehold Nations, and to serve the office of the Sentinel Marshals. Their charges must be taken in for trial unless lethal force is absolutely necessary. Finally, while Sentinel Marshals have the inherent power to extradite criminals from one nation to another, they must maintain neutrality concerning political interests between Thronehold nations. House Deneith has negotiated contracts with House Orien, Ghallanda, and Lyrandar, ensuring free travel and accommodations across Khorvaire for any Sentinel Marshal pursuing a criminal while on duty. Should a Sentinel Marshal violate this Oath, not only do they suffer the same penalties as other oathbreaking paladins, but they are also invariably 

 
excoriated from House Deneith, as the reputation and prestige of the Sentinel Marshals are among the Dragonmarked House's highest priorities. Sentinel Marshal paladins have access to the same oath features as paladins who've taken the Oath of the Patriot. However, to aid in seeking out their criminal prey, Sentinel Marshals have alternate oath spells as follows: 
 
Paladin Level Spells 3rd command, hunter’s mark 5th hold person, zone of truth 9th haste, spirit guardians 13th guardian of faith, locate creature 17th geas, scrying 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 38 Paladins have been taking this oath ever since the concept of redemption existed. Paladins of Boldrei, Dol Arrah, and Olladra throughout history have been known to take this oath. Paladins of the Silver Flame used to be the most prevalent example of paladins who swear the Oath of Redemption, but ever since the Lycanthrope Purge, and the establishment of the theocracy of Thrane, they are growing rarer among that faith. 
Unearthed Arcana: Paladin, pg. 2 While many paladins of treachery are examples of fallen paladins, holy warriors that failed to live up to the virtues and ideals of their oaths, most paladins who swear an actual Oath of Treachery are devout worshipers of The Mockery. These dark warriors usually show their devotion by flaying portions of their own skin in emulation of their dark god. 
, pg. 87 Paladins who swear the Oath of Vengeance are often seen as darker than paladins who swear other oaths. While many Vengeance paladins serve the Mockery, the Keeper, or the Dark Six as a whole, just as many who swear this oath can be found in the service of the Silver Flame or Dol Arrah, meeting out justice and dispatching those who cause harm to innocents as swiftly as possible. Paladins among the Seekers of the Divinity Within may swear the Oath of Vengeance, with the gods themselves as the ultimate target of their enmity, desiring nothing less than to righteously punish them for cursing mortals with death and oblivion in Dolurrh. 

 
 
 
  
Skilled hunters and explorers, rangers prowl the dangerous lands of Eberron, be they forest, cave, or some other environ. Many of them find home in the druidic sects of the Eldeen Reaches, scouts among the armies of the Five Nations, or walk the streets of sprawling cities. Below are two new ranger archetypes and one alternate class option for the ranger. 
 
Some rangers in the world of Eberron have no mystical connection with primal magic or druidic sects. They are skilled hunters and survivalists, or elite scouts for various nation's militaries. The following is not a subclass of the ranger, but rather an option to change the benefits provided by the base ranger class. 
The below additional features come at the cost of the ranger's magical abilities. You do not gain the ranger's Spellcasting and Primeval Awareness features. If your game uses the Unearthed Arcana Revised Ranger, you do gain the Primeval Awareness feature, but not the additional benefit described in the 3rd and 4th paragraph of that ability. At 3rd level, when you select a ranger archetype or conclave, the subclass may normally grant a feature that grants additional spells known, such as "Gloom Stalker Magic" or "Horizon Walker Magic". Instead of gaining such a feature, you learn one additional Wilderness Knack ability (see below) at 9th level. 
Beginning at 2nd level, you can study a creature to find a momentary weakness in their defenses as a bonus action. If you do, you may deal 1d8 extra damage against the creature when you hit it with a weapon attack. You may deal this extra damage only once per turn, until the start of your next turn. You deal one additional die of extra damage when you use this ability at 9th level (2d8) and 17th level (3d8). 
Your time in the wild has taught you many things. Among your repertoire of survival knowledge are several tricks, quirks, or knacks that you've developed. At 5th level, select two of any of the following abilities. At 13th levels, you learn two additional abilities. 
 
You are adept at knocking an arrow and firing effectively, even in the most inconvenient or dire circumstances. Being prone or being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with longbows or short bows. 
 
Prerequisite: Proficiency with Herbalism Kits You know how to use various plants and substances to concoct healing salves that function identically to a potion of healing (though they are applied topically, not drunk). When you are in one of your favored terrains, you may spend 4 hours searching for ingredients. If you do, make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. On a success, you find enough ingredients to concoct one healing salve, plus enough ingredients for one additional healing salve for every 5 points your ability check exceeded the DC. Each salve takes 2 hours to make, and the ingredients only retain their potency for 8 hours once gathered. Once created, a healing salve remains potent for 24 hours. 
 
Prerequisite: Proficiency in Stealth You are always on the watch for traces your companions leave behind and make it a priority to mask them as best you can. While in your favored terrain, you can move stealthily at a normal pace, even while traveling with a group, and your companions gain a bonus to their Dexterity (Stealth) checks equal to your Wisdom modifier. 
 
Prerequisite: Ranger level 13th Most tend to think rangers are solitary hunters, lone wolves striking out on their own. But you've grown accustomed to fighting with your companions, and you know wolves are more dangerous in packs. You may use the Help action to grant an ally advantage on their next attack roll against an opponent without expending an action, once per turn. 
Prerequisite: Proficiency with Poisoner's Kits You are not above using the deadly toxins of venomous beasts against your foes. You may collect venom from a freshly killed or incapacitated beast that has an attack or trait that deals poison damage or inflicts the poisoned condition. Collecting the venom requires a successful Wisdom (Survival) check with a DC equal to 10 plus the beast's challenge rating. You can collect 

 
  
 
 
 
only one dose of venom at a time, and a living creature can provide only one dose while incapacitated in any given 24-hour period. Once collected, a dose of venom remains viable indefinitely, until used as below. You can apply a dose of venom to one melee weapon, or ten pieces of ammunition. Any extra damage you deal with the weapon due to your Skilled Hunter feature is considered poison damage. The venom on the weapon or ammunition remains viable for 24 hours. If a creature other than yourself attacks with a weapon you've applied a dose of venom to, they deal poison damage equal to the extra damage you deal with your Skilled Hunter feature on their next attack, then the venom is expended. Alternatively, you may poison food or drink with a dose of venom. If you do, and the food or drink is consumed within 24 hours, the creature ingesting the food or drink must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or take poison damage equal to the extra damage you deal with your Skilled Hunter feature and be poisoned for 1 hour. 
 
Living among the vermin and insects of the nature, you have grown inured to such dangers. You are immune to disease, and you have resistance to damage dealt by swarms. 
 
Prerequisite: Proficiency with Herbalism Kits You have slowly built your tolerance to natural venoms. You have resistance to poison damage dealt by beasts and you have advantage on saving throws to resist being poisoned by beasts. Additionally, you may make antitoxin by collecting a sample from a freshly killed or incapacitated beast that has deals poison damage or inflicts the poisoned condition. Collecting the sample requires a successful Wisdom (Survival) check with a DC equal to 10 plus the beast's challenge rating, and you require 4 hours to brew one dose of antitoxin from it. You can make only one dose per sample, and a living creature can provide only one sample while incapacitated in any given 24hour period. Unlike most wilderness lore abilities, you may select this ability more than once. Each additional time after first, you can apply this ability's benefits (including the ability to harvest venom) against one additional creature type from the following list: aberrations, fiends, monstrosities, or oozes. 
 
In the wild, you know it is all too easy for the hunter to become the hunted, and you have honed your ability to sense danger and react quickly. You can’t be surprised while you are conscious and you may add your proficiency bonus to Initiative checks. 
 
Rangers of the Eldeen Reaches frequently work closely with the prominent druidic sects of the Towering Wood. Many such rangers convert fully to these sects' traditions and beliefs, or were taught their own skills and supernatural abilities by other rangers already belonging to these sects. As one of these Eldeen hunters, you learn specific techniques and gain abilities depending on your chosen druidic sect. This archetype is a variant of the Hunter archetype found in the , and shares many of the same features.  Restriction. You must abide by the teachings of one of the following druidic sects: Ashbound, Children of Winter, Gatekeepers, Greensingers, Wardens of the Wood. Your chosen sect determines several of your archetype features. 
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. Colossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn. Giant Killer. When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature. Horde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon. 
 
If your game uses the Unearthed Arcana Revised Ranger, you can use Eldeen Hunter subclass with it by making one addition: 
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

 
 
 
  
At 7th level, you gain one the features listed below appropriate to the druidic sect you belong to. Ashbound. Mage Hunter. You gain "arcane spellcasters" as a new favored enemy (arcane spellcasters typically speak draconic, as the basis of their arcane studies). Additionally, when you cast hunter's mark on an arcane spellcaster, no arcane spell can hide your quarry's location from you (Against an invisible arcane spellcaster you are still blind, but you can pinpoint their location if it is within line of sight). Children of Winter. Resist Decay. You gain resistance to poison and necrotic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease. Gatekeepers. Resist Corruption. You are immune to any effect originating from an aberration or fiend that would make you charmed or frightened. Additionally, you are immune to any effect that would change your form against your will. Greensingers. Unearthly Grace. You gain proficiency with Charisma saving throws and the Persuasion skill. Additionally, while you are wearing no armor and not using a shield, your AC is equal to 12 + your Charisma modifier + your Dexterity modifier. Wardens of the Wood. Nature's Soldier. You gain proficiency with heavy armor and your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. 
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. Volley. You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target. Whirlwind Attack. You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. 
At 15th level, you gain the feature listed below appropriate to your druidic sect. Ashbound. Arcane Resistance. You can’t be affected or detected by arcane spells of 4th level or lower unless you wish to be. You have advantage on saving throws against all other arcane spells. Children of Winter. Deathwalker. As a reaction, you can voluntarily fail a saving throw against a poison or disease. You are immune to the effects of this exposure of the poison or disease until the end of your next long rest. 
During this time, while you do not have all of your hit points you can smear your blood on a target within 5 feet of you. The target is exposed to the poison or disease and must make a saving throw against it as if it was exposed to the original source. If the target fails its saving throw, you are no longer affected by the poison or disease. If you finish a long rest before successfully transferring the poison or disease to another target, you suffer the full effect of the poison or disease without a saving throw. You regain the use of this feature whenever you finish a long rest, or when a target fails their saving throw against the poison or disease you exposed them to using this feature. Gatekeepers. Khyber's Foe. You gain several benefits which help defend you against the forces of Khyber. —You can’t be stunned. —You apply twice your proficiency bonus to any ability check to resist a grab attempt or escape being grappled, instead of any proficiency bonus you would normally apply. —You gain darkvision 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet. Greensingers. Fey Body. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Additionally, you stop aging and retain your youthful vigor until the end of your natural lifespan. You become immune to any effect that would artificially age you, such as a sphinx's lair actions or the effects of spending time on a plane of existence with altered time and returning to the material plane (such as Thelanis). Wardens of the Wood. Impeccable Parry. When another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to increase your AC against the attack by 4. 
 
Rangers with an urban soul are equally at ease in cities and towns as they are in the wilderness. They hone their keen senses and tracking skills to the nuances of urban life. They can read the flow of a crowd, find the best shortcuts, and corner their prey in the darkest of alleys. 
At 3rd level, you harmonize with the thrum of city life. You halve the cost of living a comfortable, modest, poor, or squalid lifestyle when you spend downtime in a city. You and your group can't become lost in a city except by magical means. If you are traveling in a city alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. 

 
  
 
 
 
In addition, you choose to either learn Thieves' Cant (as per the Rogue feature on page 96 of the ) or gain proficiency with one of the following: Deception, Sleight of Hand, Performance, Persuasion, Thieves' Tools, or one type of musical instrument. Finally, urban soul rangers have their fingers on the pulse of current events. When within a city, you may apply twice your proficiency bonus to Charisma checks to find out information on anything notable or newsworthy in that city (such as in which district a famous noble's estate lies, or where the last in a string of serial murders took place). 
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the loyal friendship of a beast that has adapted to urban life. Choose from any of the following animals: cat, lizard, rat (or mouse), raven (or dove or pigeon), spider, or weasel. This beast is unusually smart for its kind, with an Intelligence of 6, and it can understand one language of your choice that you speak. Additionally, you add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, as well as any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or twice your ranger level, whichever is higher. Your companion acts independently of you, but it always obeys your requests. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. It can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal (such as the Dodge or Help actions). If your companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion’s spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body. If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion. At 7th level, your relationship with your companion grows. You can teach it to be proficient in one of the following, as long as you are also proficient in it: Sleight of Hand, Survival, Stealth, Thieves' Tools. A companion proficient with thieves' tools takes ten times as long to use them. For example, if a lock normally takes an Action to unlock with Thieves' Tools, your companion requires 1 minute (10 consecutive Actions) to perform the task. Further, it must retrieve the tools from your possession in order to use them, as Thieves' Tools are too large for your companion to carry itself. 
Urban Soul rangers still draw their magic from the wild essence of nature, but for them the hustle and bustle of a metropolis is merely another kind of wilderness. At 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, you learn the following spells that don't appear on the ranger spell list. These spells are nonetheless ranger spells for you, and do not count against your limit of ranger spells known. 
 
Ranger Level Spells 3rd comprehend languages 5th see invisibility 9th speak with dead 13th Mordenkainen’s faithful hound 17th animate objects 
 
 
If your game uses the Unearthed Arcana Revised Ranger, you can use Urban Soul subclass with it by making one addition: 
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 
 
At 7th level, your urban companion can use its reaction to distract an opponent within 5 feet of it when the opponent makes an attack roll against you or your allies. If it does so, your companion imposes Disadvantage on the opponent's attack roll, then immediately moves up to half its speed without provoking an Opportunity Attack from the opponent, before the opponent's attack. 
When you reach 11th level, you may use your reaction to make an opportunity attack when an opponent you can see attacks you or one of your allies. Your opportunity attack occurs before the attack that triggers it. 
Starting at 15th level, you can easily shake off effects that control your mind. If you fail a Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma saving throw against a spell or effect, you automatically succeed your next save against the spell or effect if it grants one. 

 
 
 
  
Though the above options allow you to play various kinds of rangers in Eberron campaigns, there are many ways existing ranger options can be incorporated in the world, noted below. 
, pg. 93 or Unearthed Arcana: The Ranger, Revised pg. 5 Many rangers in Khorvaire, from the Eldeen Reaches to Q’barra, bond with a beast companion and adventure alongside them, but most frequently this bond occurs between a mount and rider from the Talenta Plains or Valenar, two cultures with ancient traditions of bonding with favored animals. Talenta halflings who choose this subclass may select a Fastieth as their companion, and Valenar elves may choose a Valenar Riding Horse or Valenar Warhorse as their companion. Statistics for these beasts can be found in The Korranberg Chronicle: Threat Dispatch. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 41 Gloom Stalker rangers are comfortable delving into the depths of Khyber. In Eberron, these rangers are oft members of the druidic sects of the Eldeen Reaches and Shadow Marches, set to patrol the tunnels and caverns of Khyber, and are charged with stopping threats to the surface before they arrive there. Additionally, House Tharashk often trains or employs Gloom Stalker rangers to protect and guide prospecting expeditions searching for Khyber dragonshards in the Underdark. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 42 Horizon Walker rangers are most likely to come from two organizations in Eberron: The Edgewalkers of Riedra, and the Gatekeepers of Khorvaire. The Edgewalkers of Riedra are a cadre of elite soldiers, chosen from the Harmonious Shield of Riedra by the nation's Inspired lords. Expert scouts and survivalists, the Edgewalkers patrol and guard against the deadly wild zones of Sarlona—manifest zones with more intense connections to their associated planes than normal. In Khorvaire, the Gatekeeper druids select from among their best hunters and trackers to teach how to sense the presence of extraplanar forces, leading many to the path of the Horizon Walker. Though less numerous, Horizon Walkers can also be found 
amongst the Greensingers, especially rangers who follow in the footsteps of planar shepherds. Outside of these organizations, some self-taught rangers native to Xen'drik naturally gravitate toward the skills and abilities of Horizon Walkers, as they become attuned to the thinned borders between realities of the Shattered Land. Regardless of origin, the Horizon Walker archetype fits as-is into the Eberron setting with one addition: Manifest Sense. The 3rd level feature, Detect Portal, is more commonly referred to as Manifest Sense, and in addition to the ability to detect the nearest planar portal, you can also detect the presence of the nearest manifest zone (including which plane of existence the manifest zone is tied to) within 5 miles. 
, pg. 93 or Unearthed Arcana: The Ranger, Revised pg. 7 Hunters are archetypical scouts and skirmishers. Martial rangers—rangers with no supernatural connection to natural magic—are more likely to be hunters than any other subclass. In the Eldeen Reaches, hunters that belong to druidic sects are often given unique training and learn special abilities dependent on their sect (see the Eldeen Hunter variant above). 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 43 The Monster Slayer archetype can easily represent a devout ranger of the Silver Flame, dedicating his life to seeking out supernaturally evil monstrosities and slaying them for the protection of the common people. Many druidic sects, such as the Gatekeepers and the Wardens of the Wood, also have rangers specifically trained to seek out such menaces. However, there are monster slayers of a more mercenary bent; those who use their talents to seek rewards from towns and villages threatened by creatures they have trained themselves to kill. 
Unearthed Arcana: Ranger & Rogue, pg. 2 Primeval Guardians are taught their ways directly from druids, and as such can be found as members of any druidic sect found in Eberron. Any of the sects of the Eldeen Reaches could be a plausible origin, as well as more obscure sources of druidic magic, such as ancient tribal traditions of Vulkoori drow in Xen'drik. Depending on the tradition a Primeval Guardian hails from, their Guardian Soul feature may let them take on a different form than the treelike person as described. For instance, a Primeval Guardian of the 

 
  
 
 
 
Greensingers may take on the form of a fey lord of the Wild Hunt, complete with stag antlers and a spectral mount that is actually a part of themself. Primeval Guardians taught by Vulkoori druids may temporarily turn into scorrow—half-drow/half-scorpion tauric creatures—when assuming their Guardian Form. In all cases, this does not change the benefits granted by Guardian Soul. 
Rogues—be they scoundrels, spies, or rakes—are dangerously skilled individuals that rely on cunning and skill rather than might or overt power to achieve their goals. Below are some suggestions on incorporating roguish archetypes into the world of Eberron. 
, pg. 97 Throughout the Five Nations, low-level magic is a common everyday occurrence. Magic is used in daily life, and the daily life of rogues is no different. The Arcane Trickster may be a charlatan, using magic to make their cons more likely to succeed, or they could be magically adept agents of some organization or another—such as the Trust of Zilargo or the Royal Eyes of Aundair—and weave illusions and enchantments to aid their missions. 
, pg. 97 Assassins are deadly individuals often in the service of some greater organization. In Eberron, they are likely to be intelligence agents in the employ of one of the Five Nations, or even more likely, assets of House Phiarlan and House Thuranni. Less lawfully-inclined assassins may be part of criminal syndicates, like the changeling-exclusive Cabinet of Faces or the aberrant marked individuals of House Tarkanan. Finally, independent assassins may be servants of The Mockery, the dark god of murder and betrayal, and their assassinations may be divinely inspired. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 46 Masterminds can come from many walks of life. While many are leaders of criminal networks, one can find lawful masterminds working as spies and double agents for the nations of the Thronehold Accords. The King's Dark Lanterns in Breland, the Royal Eyes of Aundair, and The Trust in Zilargo all employ these keen deceivers for the ultimate good of their nation. 
Originally the Inquisitive Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 45 All across Khorvaire, inquisitives ferret out clues and seek the truth to bring criminals to justice, but Master Inquisitives are a cut above the rest. House Medani and House Tharashk officially license their own inquisitive agencies, many of which employ the innate powers of the Houses' dragonmarks to find and hunt down culprits. Many more are employed directly by the city watch as official investigators. In especially dangerous or populated cities, such as Sharn, private inquisitive agencies spring up to meet demand. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 47 The Scout represents a survivalist that is less in touch with nature—as a ranger would be—and is more in opposition to it. Scouts are rogues that study every trick, snag, and deadfall that can befall a body traveling in the wilds. While they have extensive knowledge of nature, most are still vastly more comfortable in a well-run tavern where the ale flows freely. Still, they pride themselves on the ability to not flounder in the face of simple natural obstacles their city-slicker associates may find themselves harried by. Many Scouts received their training in the Last War, serving in reconnaissance units and ranging ahead of the front-line warriors. Other Scouts train themselves to be ready for adventures into the wilderness, and many find lucrative careers as guides for Wayfinder Foundation or Dragonmarked House expeditions. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 47 Across the Five Nations, the Swashbucklers are often envied and admired. Featured in many tales of derringdo told by bards and chronicles alike, there's a certain romantic image of the dashing swordsman that drives many to hone the arts of the blade bravo. The fighting style of the Swashbuckler is particularly favored in the Lhazaar Principalities and around Stormreach, where more heavily armored warriors are at a distinct disadvantage on the high seas. Swashbucklers can also be found among the upper class of the Five Nations, where strutting into the gala of the year in clanking full plate would be a serious faux pas but leaving yourself defenseless amongst your most dangerous "friends" would be just as unappealing. 
 

 
 
 
  
, pg. 97 While many rogues who adhere to this archetype might well be criminals, the skill set of the Thief archetype also lends itself to delving into the deepest, most dangerous dungeons and ruins of ancient civilizations to retrieve artifacts and relics. Many such “retrieval specialists” work legitimately for institutions such as Morgrave University or the Argentum Archive. 
Sorcerers are talented spellcasters that come into their arcane might through an in-born power. In Eberron, inherited magical ability is a hallmark of dragonmarks, prophetic symbols that appear on the body and grant some power to their bearers. But not all dragonmarks are created equal. Below are two new sorcerous origins for the world of Eberron, each representing one kind of immensely powerful dragonmark. 
Your innate magic comes from a true dragonmark unlike any other in recent history, surpassing even the promise of a Siberys-level dragonmark. Your mark is an Apex Dragonmark, one of only a handful of dragonmarks identified throughout history that matched it in power and potential.  Restriction. The apex version of a true dragonmark only ever appears among the descendants of true dragonmarked bloodlines. In order to qualify for this subclass, you need to be related by blood (even if distantly) to one of the appropriate Houses and be of the appropriate race or races as listed below. (For example, a half-elf born from a House Phiarlan elf and a human would not meet the prerequisites for the Apex Mark of Shadow, because while she has a blood relation to House Phiarlan, she is not of the appropriate race. Only elves may bear the Mark of Shadow.) Note that you need not be of a Dragonmarked subrace, merely related by blood to those who are. 
Starting at 1st level, you manifest a least dragonmark. This dragonmark is roughly the size of your palm, though it can appear anywhere on your body. Each true dragonmark has its own pattern, a blue-green shimmering symbol that appears anywhere on your body.

The dragonmark grants you magical powers. You gain the cantrip and Least benefit according to the Apex Dragonmark Spells table. You treat these spells as sorcerer spells you know, but they do not count against your limit of known sorcerer spells or cantrips. Additionally, all of your sorcerer spells are cast as innate spells, requiring no somatic, verbal, or material components (except those with a listed cost). Instead, your apex dragonmark itself flares with brilliant light which is extremely noticeable (even through clothing or armor) whenever you cast a sorcerer spell. At 3rd level, when you gain access to the Metamagic class feature, you can select the Subtle Spell metamagic effect and use it to cast a spell without manifesting this eye-catching flare of power. 
At 6th level, your apex dragonmark grows into a lesser dragonmark, increasing in size to about three hand spans. You learn both spells available under the Lesser benefit for your type of dragonmark according to the Apex Dragonmark Spells table. You treat these spells as sorcerer spells you know, but they do not count against your limit of known sorcerer spells. In addition, you can channel the power of your apex dragonmark to vitalize your body, sacrificing your power for health. As a bonus action on your turn, you may convert Sorcery Points to Hit Dice on a onefor-one basis. You cannot convert Hit Dice back into Sorcery Points. 
Also at 6th level, your dragonmark develops visible flourishes that differentiate it from other true dragonmarks, no longer appearing identical to others of its kind. This visible difference marks you as one possessing a special destiny or prophetic importance

and is quite impressive to those in power and with a keen interest in the Draconic Prophecy. Whenever you make a Charisma check when dealing with nobles, creatures possessing a true dragonmark, individuals with a keen interest in the Draconic Prophecy, or dragons, you apply twice your proficiency bonus on the check, instead of any proficiency bonus you may have. 
When you reach 14th level, your mark continues to expand, growing into a greater dragonmark, spreading across a significant portion of your body (such as your chest, back, or an entire limb). You learn all spells available under the Greater benefit for your type of dragonmark according to the Apex Dragonmark Spells table. You treat these spells as sorcerer spells you know, but they do not count against your limit of known sorcerer spells. 
Starting at 14th level, you can channel the power of your dragonmark to adjust your destiny. You may concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell) for 5 minutes. At the end of this duration, you may sacrifice a spell slot to gain a number of Luck points equal to one third the level of the sacrificed spell slot (rounded down, minimum 1 Luck point). Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend a luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend your luck point after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You can also spend a luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20, and then choose 
whether the attack uses the attacker’s roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled. Once expended, Luck points gained through this ability do not return. Once you begin concentrating on this ability, you may not do so again until you finish a long rest. 
Upon attaining 18th level, your apex dragonmark rapidly crawls across your entire body, covering every inch of your flesh in its complex pattern and becoming a Siberys dragonmark. You learn the spell available for your type of dragonmark according to the Apex Dragonmark Spells table. You treat this spell as sorcerer spell you know, but it does not count against your limit of known sorcerer spells. In addition, when you have at least 1 Sorcery Point remaining, your mark grants you a boon. Choose one of the below options. Once the choice has been made, it cannot be changed.  • You gain resistance to one type of damage. • Your hit point maximum increases by 2 hit points per sorcerer level you possess, and it increases by 2 more hit points for every additional sorcerer level you take. • Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, the spell deals additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus (applied to only one roll of your choice if a spell has multiple attacks or targets). • You gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your proficiency bonus. • You gain proficiency in one saving throw. 
 

 
 
 
  
Your innate magic comes from one of the most potent aberrant dragonmarks Khorvaire has seen for centuries. You might have been the forbidden progeny of two parents with greater true dragonmarks, excoriated from their houses to raise you in secret. Perhaps you have simply manifested the aberrant mark suddenly—during a time of great stress or danger—and have no idea why you were chosen for this power. Aberrant marks are looked upon with distrust across Khorvaire, and most aberrant marked individuals hide theirs from view. Disconcertingly, however, yours seems to grow just a bit every day. 
Starting at 1st level, you manifest a least aberrant dragonmark. This dragonmark is roughly the size of your palm, though it can appear anywhere on your body. While each true dragonmark has its own pattern, their blue-green shimmering nature makes them easy to recognize as related to each other. Aberrant dragonmarks however are visually distinct from true dragonmarks and appear in myriad different fashions (you can roll randomly from the Aberrant Mark Manifestations table below, select an entry you like, or come up with your own idea). 
 
d6 Manifestation 1 Shimmering lines similar to true dragonmarks, but angry red and black instead of blue and green. 2 An open, twisting wound that continually wells a small amount of blood, but never heals. 3 A patch of necrotic dead flesh that rots away normal clothing that comes in contact with it. 4 A third degree burn that never fades. 5 A shadow cast by an unknown light source that only appears on your flesh. 6 Weeping sores that constantly seep yellow puss that forms the mark. 
 
The aberrant dragonmark grants you strange powers, unknown to most sorcerers. Pick any one 1stlevel warlock or wizard spell. You treat this spell as sorcerer spell you know, but it does not count against your limit of known sorcerer spells. Additionally, all your sorcerer spells are cast as innate spells, requiring no somatic, verbal, or material 
components (except those with a listed cost). Instead, the dragonmark itself flares with dark light or otherwise becomes extremely noticeable (even through clothing or armor) whenever you cast a sorcerer spell. At 3rd level, when you gain access to the Metamagic class feature, you can select the Subtle Spell metamagic effect and use it to cast a spell without manifesting this eye-catching flare of power. 
 
At 6th level, your aberrant dragonmark grows into a lesser aberrant dragonmark, increasing in size to about three hand spans. Pick any one 2nd or 3rd level warlock or wizard spell. You treat this spell as sorcerer spell you know, but it does not count against your limit of known sorcerer spells. In addition, you can channel your vital essence through your aberrant dragonmark, sacrificing your health for power. As a bonus action on your turn, you may convert Hit Dice to Sorcery Points on a one-forone basis. Sorcery Points gained this way disappear after a short or long rest. You cannot convert Sorcery Points back into Hit Dice. 
Also at 6th level, your aberrant mark is the most intricate and powerful the world has seen in centuries, and you gain a measure of influence over beings similarly touched by Khyber. Whenever you make a Charisma check when dealing with aberrations, creatures native to Khyber, or creatures that possess an aberrant dragonmark, you apply twice your proficiency bonus on the check, instead of any proficiency bonus you may have. 
When you reach 14th level, your mark continues to expand, growing into a greater aberrant dragonmark, spreading across a significant portion of your body (such as your chest, back, or an entire limb). Select any one 4th, 5th, or 6th level warlock or wizard spell. You treat this spell as sorcerer spell you know, but it does not count against your limit of known sorcerer spells. 
Starting at 14th level, you can consume the good fortune of others. As a reaction, within 30 feet of you, you can cancel a use of Inspiration, negate a spent Luck point, or prevent a creature from benefiting from advantage. You then gain advantage on your next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check you make 

 
  
 
 
 
before the end of your next turn. You cannot use this ability again until you have completed a long rest. 
Upon attaining 18th level, your aberrant dragonmark rapidly crawls across your entire body, covering every inch of your flesh in its twisted pattern and becoming a Khyber aberrant dragonmark. Select any one 7th, 8th, or 9th level spell from any class spell list, except wish. You treat this spell as sorcerer spell you know, but it does not count against your limit of known sorcerer spells. In addition, when you have at least 1 Sorcery Point remaining, your mark grants you a boon. Choose one of the below options. Once the choice has been made, it cannot be changed.  • You gain resistance to one type of damage. • Your hit point maximum increases by 2 hit points per sorcerer level you possess, and it increases by 2 more hit points for every additional sorcerer level you take. • Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, the spell deals additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus (applied to only one roll of your choice if a spell has multiple attacks or targets). • You gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your proficiency bonus. • You gain proficiency in one saving throw. 
The above sorcerous origins capitalize on the inheritable magic of dragonmarks, but dragonmarks are not the only kinds of innate sorcery. Below are some suggestions on incorporating other sorcerous origins into the world of Eberron. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 50 Divine Souls are sorcerers whose innate magic comes from a divine blessing. While the birth of divine soul is exceedingly rare, the Sovereign Host and the Blood of Vol seem to produce the most of them. Though no mortal has ever glimpsed the face of one of the Sovereign Host, their vassals believe they do make themselves known in the world through miracles and divine magic, with divine souls just being another one of their many gifts. The Seekers of the Blood of Vol believe that divine souls are born from bloodlines exceedingly close in unlocking the divinity within, with their lineage showcasing an innate ability to channel 
this divine energy without the need for contemplation and prayer. The Silver Flame and the Undying Court are both religions with a clearer connection to their divine patron or force, and as such many parents seeking a blessing for their child may petition the Voice of the Flame, through the Keeper of the Flame, or the Undying Court for their favor. However, these entities rarely ever do so, perhaps seeing it as their responsibility to ensure their favor is only ever placed on the truly righteous. 
, pg. 102 A Draconic Bloodline is most likely more metaphorical than literal in the world of Eberron. The dragons of Argonnessen are remote and dispassionate observers of lesser beings and have a history of reacting violently to interbreeding. However, the dragons are possessed of powerful magic that can bestow their attributes onto servitors or guardians. The dragonborn race are believed to be the result of one such powerful blessing. A Draconic Bloodline sorcerer could be a different manifestation of such an endowment, and sorcerers of this origin are typically found amongst the savage tribes of the Seren Isles or the dragonborn of Q’barra. More rarely, an agent of the Chamber may bestow such power onto an associate—usually someone clueless as to the true nature of the draconic agent—acting on what they believe to be a branch of the Prophecy. 
Originally Phoenix Sorcery Unearthed Arcana: Sorcerer, pg. 1 Fernia, the Sea of Fire, is believed to be the source of all flames and is known to be populated by spirits of fire and immolation. Fernian sorcerers typically believe themselves to have been born or conceived in a manifest zone tied to Fernia, though not all claims of this can be verified. Some sorcerers of this origin may choose to believe themselves some kind of special Divine Soul, blessed by Onatar, the Sovereign of Forge and Fire. These sorcerers are more likely to attempt to use their powers constructively, and often choose backgrounds and classes that grant them proficiency with one or more kinds of artisan's tools that would benefit from their powers (such as smith's tools or glassblower's supplies). A small number of Fernian sorcerers insist that they are the byproducts of willing or unwilling participation in illegal elemental binding rituals and owe their power to a fire elemental being bound to their souls. Such Fernian sorcerers may have more 

 
 
 
  
obvious signs of their sorcerous power, such as coalblack skin or veins that visibly glow with a fiery light. 
Unearthed Arcana: Giant Soul Sorcerer Xen’drik was the ancient home of a vast and powerful civilization of giants, but now it is known as the Shattered Land, a vast wilderness of ruins and savages. Still, some of the potent magic of giants lingers in their artifacts, relics, and fallen cities. Every so often, adventurers and expeditions successfully retrieve such treasures and bring them back to Khorvaire. Giant Soul sorcerers are individuals who have inherited some of the innate magic of these relics, possibly from their parents who bore the magic before them. Some may feel cursed by their ancient powers, drawn inexorably toward Xen’drik as though an urge alien to their own consciousness demands their power be restored to its place of rest. Others feel no such pull, and simply revel in the power and glory such might bestows upon them. Among the Sulatar drow, Fire Giant Soul sorcerers are especially favored and considered a great omen for their communities, often elevated to positions of honor and rulership. In the world of Eberron, the history of giants and their realms differ from the standard D&D assumptions, resulting in the following changes: Mark of Apotheosis. The ancient giants discovered the secrets of elemental apotheosis, granting them primordial sovereignty over the elements of the cosmos. Each nation, city, or community of giants favored one kind of elemental apotheosis over the others, and the relics that empower Giant Soul sorcerers channel these ancient rituals. This renames the Mark of the Ordning feature, as there was no divine mandate from giant gods that determined their castes in Eberron. Soul of Lost Cul’sir. This renames the Soul of Lost Ostoria ability, as the most prominent ancient giant empire in Eberron was the Empire of Cul’sir, and no mythical realm called Ostoria existed. Some Sulatar drow may instead refer to this feature as the “Soul of the Sul’at League”. Rage of the Titans. Likewise, as Ostoria is not an element of giant history in Eberron, this ability is renamed to reference the ancient giants of old, before their devolution into the giants of modern times. Blessing of the Emperor. The giants did not worship a god they named the All Father, so instead this ability alludes to the ancient Titan King and Emperor of the giant civilization before it collapsed. 
Unearthed Arcana: Sorcerer, pg. 2 Many Sea sorcerers consider themselves to be cursed by The Devourer and are ashamed of their powers, hiding their perceived profane origin from others for fear of persecution. Such sorcerers may have discovered their power after surviving a shipwreck and believe themselves to have been spared by The Devourer for some dark purpose. However, a great number of Sea sorcerers consider their power a mere natural affinity, perhaps tied to an aspect of Lamannia, a plane of existence with vast, endless oceans. Many aquatic races, especially the sahuagin, claim a higher than normal frequency of birthing Sea sorcerers. Like Fernian sorcerers, there are a few sea sorcerers with wild claims that their power comes from a water elemental bound to their souls. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 50 In Eberron games, the power of shadow magic flows from the plane of Mabar instead of the Shadowfell. Many Shadow sorcerers are descendants of elven families that fled persecution in Aerenal for associating with the line of Vol or for having blood tainted with the energies of Mabar. Over the centuries since, such taint may have spread to half-elves and humans among the population of Khorvaire. Still others may have volunteered (or were volunteered by their parents at a young age) for a ritual performed by the Blood of Vol, who are constantly seeking a way to end death. Among the Umbragen drow, most sorcerers have an innately strong bond with the Umbra and are Shadow sorcerers who draw their power from that force instead of Mabar. 
Unearthed Arcana: Sorcerer, pg. 3 Dwarves have the longest recorded history of Stone sorcerers, with tales and legends dating back to their migration from the Frostfell. Stone sorcerers are highly prized by militaries for their unusual intimacy with metal arms and armor, allowing them to cast their spells and support troops in situations where other spellcasters would be considerably more vulnerable. While most stone sorcerers attribute their powers to a planar connection to Lamannia or even Eberron itself, a few stone sorcerers of questionable morals or sanity claim to glean their powers from the underworld, Khyber. An even smaller, more questionable number of stone sorcerers claim unethical experiments performed on them by the elemental binders of Zilargo lead to their powers. 

 
  
 
 
 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 51 While sorcerers born to Dragonmarked Houses often achieve high levels of prestige, they do not necessarily automatically manifest their lineage's dragonmark. Often, such sorcerers get a mundane tattoo in the shape of their family's Least mark as a sign of respect. Storm Sorcerers of House Lyrandar, however, are a bit different from the norm. Though they too do not always manifest a dragonmark immediately, they are more likely to do so than sorcerers of other Houses, and Storm Sorcerers seem to manifest the Siberys Mark of Storm with startling regularity. Beyond house heirs, there are a few bewildering examples of storm sorcerers who claim their powers came from seedy experiments that left air elementals bound to their souls. 
, pg. 103 The world of Eberron is influenced strongly by the planes which surround it, the energies and realty of these dimensions bleeding into the material plane in manifest zones. One such plane, Kythri, the Churning Chaos, is the most likely cause of the Wild Magic sorcerous origin. Sometimes when a humanoid is born or lives in a manifest zone linked to Kythri, the chaos of the plane seeps into their very being, altering them. If the person already has a magical talent for the arcane, the influence of Kythri will wildly alter their magic in unpredictable ways. 

 
 
 
 
Surrounded. Again. The small guard of pikemen she'd picked up did little to enhance her confidence. The Thranes were archers, all with arrows nocked. A soldier's shield rattled against his greaves as fear set his arm to shaking. Where did they pick up these recruits? Taking a breath, Farryn exhaled the words of a spell, the darkness of teleportation blinking across her sight for a moment. The archers fired, but she had three dead before the others realised what had happened. Raising her sword and kindling a spell to life, she beckoned at the next Thrane in line. 
With a shout, an elf swings her longsword, extending her reach through time and space to strike at the troll, igniting her steel with arcane fire to sear the monster from within. Extorting his allies to follow him, bolstering their resolve and quickening their steps with an arcane gesture, a human leads his companions into the breach toward their common foe. Studying her enemies, a tiefling devises a cunning plan. A wall of arcane force springs into existence among them, splitting their forces in half. Then with a befuddling word, her enemies begin fighting amongst themselves, leaving her to mop up the survivors. With a defiant shout, a gnome extends the magical protections that guard him out toward his allies as well, ensuring they will hold the line against the oncoming enemy soldiers charging directly toward his position. Swordmages apply their arcane talents on the front lines of combat. While all study and learn to cast spells, they each focus their learning on how best to bend the universal force of magic toward victory. 
 
One hundred years of war did more than reshape the political boundaries of the Five Nations. During this time, the Last War seemed endless, and the question of how best to fight one’s enemies and bring victory to crown and country were on the thoughts and lips of most concerned citizens. Generations of talented spellcasters were born, raised, and thrust into this era. The result was the art of the swordmage; the practical application of magic to steel, refined from ancient traditions that could afford to be more artistic with their spell-weaving. Swordmagic is a narrowly focused—some would say brutish—field of magic, but preeminently effective at what it does. 
 
To fight without a plan is to hand victory to one's enemies. Every swordmage, as a student of war and magic, develops their arcane talent toward what they believe to be the surest path to victory. Though the study of arcane magic is typically thought to occur in libraries, universities, or under the tutelage of cloistered masters in remote towers, swordmages buck these traditions and seek their magic out in the world. Further, these itinerant scholars don't pursue magic for its own ends, but rather incorporate it into their burgeoning treatises on warfare.

Creating a swordmage means first deciding what kind of tactician you want to be. Thought you don't select class features that concretely designate your battlefield philosophy until you reach 3rd level, deciding what kind of warrior you are—or want to be—early can help you inform your choice. Do you see yourself as a cunning, ruthless guerilla fighter? Are you unconcerned with subtleties and seek only the get into conflict as fast and hard as possible? Are you more defensive, or do you believe supporting your comrades will grant you the most likely victory? Another question you must answer is where you first learned magic. Did you once apprentice under a traditional wizard, but chafed at the sedentary lifestyle? Did you learn swordmagic from a mentor, a traveling warrior-philosopher that taught you everything they knew? Perhaps you enlisted in a military organization that saw your potential for spellcasting and inducted you into the ranks of an arcane knightly order. 
You can make a swordmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity, then Constitution. Second, choose the soldier background. Third, choose the booming blade and lightning lure cantrips.
 
 
 
As a swordmage, you gain the following class features. 
Hit Dice: 1d10 per swordmage level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per swordmage level after 1st 
Armor: Light armor Weapons: All simple weapons and greatswords, longswords, rapiers, and short swords Tools: None Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Athletics, History, Intimidation, Insight, Investigation 
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: 
 
• (a) a greatsword, (b) a longsword, (c) a rapier, or (d) two short swords • (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack • (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus • a spellbook  

 
 
 
  
While you are not wearing any armor or using a shield, you have the ability to conjure an arcane aegis, a magical field of force that protects you, after a minute of concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Your arcane aegis is invisible and weightless and it grants you an Armor Class of 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. At 10th level, it improves to grant you an Armor Class equal to 12 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. Your arcane aegis lasts for 8 hours, or until you don armor or use a shield. Starting at 1st level, while you are protected by your arcane aegis and have a free hand (a hand not wielding a weapon or holding an item), you gain an additional +2 bonus to AC. Beginning at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects while you are protected by your arcane aegis and have a hand free. 
As a swordmage, you study arcane magic as a philosopher, transcribing your spells in a spellbook. See chapter 10 of the for the general rules of spellcasting and the section at the end of this document for the swordmage spell list. 
 
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the swordmage spell list. You learn a third cantrip of your choice at 10th level. 
 
At 1st level, you have a spellbook, but it does not yet contain any spells. It only contains the beginning research into three 1st level swordmage spells of your choice that you are working on learning. When you reach 2nd level, you finish this work and complete these three 1st level swordmage spells, adding them to your spellbook. Starting at 3rd level, and every level thereafter, you add one swordmage spell of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Swordmage table. On your adventurers, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the "A Swordmage's Spellbook" sidebar). 
 
 
 
The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the philosophy of arcane might as applied to warfare that you refine as you progress, as well as the insights gleaned through battling your enemies and testing their philosophies against yours. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in a chest, for example, or take it from a rival swordmage's spellbook after you defeated them in battle. Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a swordmage spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the mage who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book---for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many swordmages keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a sturdy iron-backed tome secured to your belt by a thick chain to keep it from being lost in battle, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a route. 
 
 
 
The Swordmage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. Beginning at 2nd level, you prepare the list of swordmage spells that are available for you to cast, choosing a number of spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your swordmage level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level swordmage, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell burning hands, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of swordmage spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. 
 
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your swordmage spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a swordmage spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a swordmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
 
Spell Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier 
 
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5 of the ) as a spellcasting focus for your swordmage spells. 
You are adept at focusing your arcane will along the honed edge of a blade. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can meditate while practicing with a greatsword, longsword, rapier, or up to two short swords for one minute. If you do, you can use the weapon or weapons you meditated and practiced with as a spellcasting focus when casting swordmage spells. Additionally, when you attack with that weapon or weapons, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. These benefits last until you finish a long rest. If you later acquire a magic weapon, these benefits extend to it so long as you are attuned to the magic weapon. Starting at 17th level, your focus becomes as unbreakable as the weapons you channel it through. Damage can no longer cause you to lose concentration on swordmage spells, maxims, or other axiom features while you are wielding a weapon you gain the above benefits with. 
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. 
 
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be protected by your arcane aegis and have a free hand (a hand not wielding a weapon or holding an item). 
 
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. 
 
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. 
 
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. 

 
 
 
  
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one swordmage spell slot to deal force damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. If you have prepared a swordmage spell of 1st level or higher that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, the extra damage can be of that type, instead of force damage. You can decide each time you expend a spell slot to use this feature. 
When you reach 3rd level, you forge your technique of melding arcane might and honed steel into a complex philosophy, an arcane axiom of battle. Choose one of these four axioms: Assault, Command, Division, or Fortitude, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include axiom spells and the Maxim feature. 
 
Each axiom has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the axiom description. Once you gain access to an axiom spell, you copy it to your spellbook for free and always have it prepared. Axiom spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain an axiom spell that doesn't appear on the swordmage spell list, the spell is nonetheless a swordmage spell for you. 
 
As part of your formulated axiom, you codify two arcane phrases that exemplify your battle philosophy and manifest magical effects. Each Maxim option provided by your axiom explains how to use it. When you use your Maxim, you choose which phrase to recite. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Maxim again. Some Maxim effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your swordmage spell save DC. Beginning at 11th level, you can use your Maxim twice between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. 
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of 
your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 
Starting at 6th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. Beginning at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. 
When you reach 9th level, your keen tactical intuition has been honed to a near supernatural degree by your experiences and studies, allowing you to anticipate enemy moves and react quickly to them. You can no longer be surprised, and you may add your Intelligence modifier as a bonus when rolling for initiative. Beginning at 13th level, your mental alacrity improves even further, granting you a bonus on all saving throws equal to your Intelligence modifier. You do not gain this bonus if you are unconscious. 
Modern day swordmages steadfastly believe that the side of any battle that most effectively employs magic is the side that is most assured of victory. However, not all swordmages agree on which application of magic is most effective. Most swordmages develop their own personal philosophies, or Axioms, that dictate the "proper" use of arcane might on the battlefield. 
 
The old adage goes "the best offense is a good defense", but you never understood that. For you, the best offense is a good offense. The surest way to victory is the quickest, most direct application of overwhelming force possible. You have little patience for subtly, instead honing your arcane abilities to get you into the front lines as quickly as conceivably possible and to deliver retribution for attacks dealt to your allies. 
Swordmages who subscribe to the Axiom of Assault study magic that aids them in their goal of getting into melee, wherever that might be. Teleportation spells of 

 
  
 
 
 
the conjuration school of magic, as well as transmutation spells that work to increase the caster’s or their allies’ movement capabilities, are part and parcel to your combat philosophy. 
You gain axiom spells at the swordmage levels listed. 
 
Swordmage Level Spells 3rd hunter's mark, zephyr strike* 5th find steed, misty step 9th haste, thunder step* 13th dimension door, freedom of movement 17th far step*, steel wind strike* *These spells can be found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything 
When you decide to adhere to this Axiom at 3rd level, you gain the following two Maxim options. Retribution is the Best Deterrence. As an action, you can recite this maxim and magically attune yourself to the energies of time and space. For one minute afterward, whenever an ally you can see is attacked, you may expend a 1st level or higher spell slot as a reaction to teleport up to 30 feet into an unoccupied space near the enemy that attacked your ally, so long as you can hit that enemy with a melee attack from that space. You then make a melee weapon attack against that enemy. If your attack hits, you deal a d8 of extra force damage per level of the spell slot you expended to teleport. You cannot apply extra damage from Spell Strike to this attack. Your teleport and attack occur before the triggering attack from the enemy. Attack from All Sides. As a bonus action, you can recite this maxim and magically attune yourself to the barrier between the planes. For one minute afterward, you gain the ability to strike through instantaneous portals that open just long enough for you to attack through them, granting you a 10-foot bonus to your reach with all melee weapon attacks for the duration of this ability. 
Beginning at 7th level, whenever you are protected by your arcane aegis and are wielding a weapon, you can't become stunned and you gain a 10-foot bonus to your base walking speed. 
At 15th level, your velocity ward improves so that you cannot become grappled, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned when protected by your arcane aegis and wielding a weapon, and the bonus to your base walking speed granted by your velocity ward increases to 30 feet. 
At 20th level, you have formulated the complete philosophy of magical assault warfare. Once on each of your turns, as part of your movement you can spend up to half of your movement to teleport the same number of feet you spent. When you do, you may make two melee weapon attacks as a bonus action immediately following the teleport. 
 
No single sword wielded by a lone warrior, nor a single spell slung by a lone mage, has ever won a war. You have come to the realization that the truest path to victory is to be at the side of trusted, capable allies. Though you offer inspiration and tactical commands, you do not necessarily see yourself as superior to your allies. The best teams are ones made up of a group of talented individuals who each bring something unique to the united whole. 
Swordmages that adhere to the Axiom of Command incorporate the most eclectic mix of spells in their philosophy, more so than most other Axioms. This is because as leaders among equals, these swordmages believe the best application of their magic is to provide the most utility to their team. Bolstering spells, communication spells, divination spells, and spells that can provide a safe haven to plan in privacy are all among the repertoire of the Axiom of Command. 
You gain axiom spells at the swordmage levels listed. 
 
Swordmage Level Spells 3rd alarm, heroism 5th enhance ability, rope trick 9th clairvoyance, haste 13th freedom of movement, Mordenkainen's private sanctum 17th Rary's telepathic bond, scrying 

 
 
 
  
When you decide to adhere to this Axiom at 3rd level, you gain the following two Maxim options. Focused Strikes Over Blind Aggression. As an action, you can recite this maxim and magically link yourself to all allies you can see. For one minute afterward, whenever you hit an enemy with an attack, as a reaction you can expend a spell slot to grant one linked ally the opportunity to make an attack against the same enemy. If the chosen ally elects to make an attack, they receive a bonus to their attack roll and damage roll equal to twice the level of the spell slot you expended. We Move as One. As a bonus action, you can recite this maxim and magically link yourself to all allies you can see. For one minute afterward, whenever your turn ends and you moved any distance during that turn, linked allies can take a reaction to move the same amount of distance. 
At 3rd level, you learn to cast any spell you know with the ritual tag as a ritual (by increasing the casting time of the spell by 10 minutes, you can cast it without expending a spell slot). If you have a ritual spell in your spellbook, you can cast it as a ritual without having to prepare it. 
When you reach 7th level, you may add four wizard spells of up to 2nd level that have the ritual tag to your spellbook. These spells are not swordmage spells or axiom spells, and you cannot prepare them or cast them from spell slots. You can, however, cast them as rituals. 
At 15th level, you add an additional four wizard spells of up to 4th level that have the ritual tag to your spellbook. Like the rituals you learned at 7th level, these are not swordmage spells or axiom spells, you cannot be prepared or cast from spell slots, and you can only cast them as rituals. 
At 20th level, you have completed your unifying theory of team-based tactical warfare. Whenever you are conscious and not incapacitated, any ally within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you gains the following benefits (you are considered one of these allies for the below benefits as well): 
 
• Affected allies are proficient in all skills, weapons, tools, and armor that any ally who also benefits from this ability is. • When reduced to 0 hit points, affected allies are not incapacitated and may keep fighting so long as there is another ally benefiting from this ability with more than 0 hit points. Affected allies still make death saves at the end of their turn and accrue failures each time they are damaged. • Affected allies can use any spell or feature that requires the ally to touch another creature to bestow its benefits at any range, so long as their target is an ally benefiting from this ability • If the affected ally has spell slots, they can expend a spell slot to cast any spell another ally benefiting from this ability has prepared or knows, even if it is not on their class's spell list. 
 
"Divide and Conquer" is the core of your warfare stratagems. You believe the surest way to defeat your opponent in any conflict to is to outwit, outmaneuver, and outplay your enemies. You are a cunning tactician, willing to use ambushes or other dirty tactics to achieve victory. Whatever is necessary to cut off your enemies from support and vanquish them. 
Swordmages who adhere to the Axiom of Division most often include illusion, enchantment, and evocation spells that erect sudden walls as the centerpieces in their spellcasting repertoire. With illusions and walls, you can scatter your enemies and shape the battlefield to your advantage, while enchantment spells can divide your enemies and set them against each other. 

 
  
 
 
 
You gain axiom spells at the swordmage levels listed. 
 
Swordmage Level Spells 3rd silent image, Tasha's hideous laughter 5th crown of madness, invisibility 9th hypnotic pattern, wall of sand* 13th hallucinatory terrain, wall of fire 17th dominate person, wall of force *This spell can be found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything 
When you decide to adhere to this Axiom at 3rd level, you gain the following two Maxim options. The Essence of Warfare is Deception. As an Action, you can recite this maxim to create illusory duplicates of yourself. When you do, you expend a spell slot and create one perfect illusion of yourself for each level of the spell slot expended. All illusions created through this maxim last for as long as you concentrate on it (as though concentrating on a spell), for up to 1 minute, and they appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move one or more illusions up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but they must remain within 120 feet of you. For the duration, you when you take the Attack action, an illusion can make any or all of the attacks, instead of you, but you must use your own senses to perceive what the illusion is attacking. These illusions are equipped exactly as you are, and make attack and damage rolls as you do, except all damage they deal is psychic damage and they cannot add extra damage with a Spell Strike when they hit with an attack. Additionally, when both an illusion and either your or one of your allies are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you or your ally have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target. Appear Near When You Are Far. As a bonus action, you can recite this maxim and magically attune yourself to veil between dimensions. For one minute afterward, whenever an enemy you can see attacks you or an ally, or begins casting a spell, you may teleport that enemy 15 feet in any direction as a reaction, so long as the destination is an unoccupied, non-hazardous space and the enemy fails a Charisma saving throw. This teleport occurs after their attack is made or spell is cast. 
Beginning at 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse enchantments and illusions into your arcane aegis, befuddling enemies who try to attack you and fail. Whenever an enemy makes a melee attack against you while you are protected by your arcane aegis and have a hand free, if the attack misses the enemy has disadvantage on all further attack rolls until the start of its next turn. Creatures that are immune to being charmed or that have truesight are not affected by this ability. 
At 15th level, you can weave even more perplexing magical distractions into your arcane aegis. Whenever an enemy has disadvantage on attack rolls due to your Disorienting Ward, all attacks rolls against the enemy have advantage. 
At 20th level, you have perfected your philosophy of dividing enemy forces into a single, devastating magical disruption. When you use this disruption, all enemies within 120 feet of you that you can see must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, the disruption has no effect, but each creature who fails their saving throw considers every creature who succeeded on the save to be their mortal enemy. Whenever an affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target from among the creatures who succeeded on their saving throw to resist the disruption that it can see, and it must choose to target such creatures with an attack, spell, or other ability with enough range to affect the target. If no creatures who succeeded on their saving throw remain alive or are in sight, an affected creature can choose their targets normally. This magical disruption persists as long as you concentrate on it (as though concentrating on a spell), for up to 1 minute. Each time an affected creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are immune to being charmed automatically pass their saving throw to resist this disruption. You can use this ability once, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. 
 

 
 
 
  
The old adage goes "the best offense is a good defense", and you couldn't agree more. Attrition has won more wars than daring assaults, and you hold to this Axiom with a stubbornness so intense it becomes a virtue. You will fortify, consolidate, and weather any storm, to protect not only yourself, but all those who rely on you. 
As you develop the Axiom of Fortitude, you focus your arcane studies on magic that can solidify your defenses and resist damage. Abjuration and transmutation spells are the brick and mortar of the wall you will make yourself into. 
 
Swordmage Level Spells 3rd armor of Agathys, shield 5th protection from poison, warding bond 9th meld into stone, protection from energy 13th death ward, stoneskin 17th circle of power, wall of stone 
When you decide to adhere to this Axiom at 3rd level, you gain the following two Maxim options. Be Strong Where They Believe You Are Weak. As a bonus action, you can recite this maxim and energize your arcane aegis, expanding wisps of its protective field outward to protect your allies when you channel arcane power into it. For one minute afterward, whenever an ally you can see is attacked, you may expend a 1st level or higher spell slot as a reaction to add a bonus to that ally's AC equal to three times the level of the spell slot expended. This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn and applies against the triggering attack. The Body is a Shield that Cannot be Turned Aside. As a bonus action, you can recite this maxim and magically fortify your flesh. For one minute afterward, you gain resistance to all damage except psychic damage. 
Beginning at 7th level, whenever you are protected by your arcane aegis and have a hand free, you cannot be moved any distance against your will and you cannot be swallowed by a creature capable of swallowing other creatures whole. 
At 15th level, this benefit extends to all allies within 30 feet of you while you are conscious. 
At 20th level, you can weave magic to create the perfect fortification. You may cast the mighty fortress spell (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, pg. 161) once, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Whenever you use this ability to cast mighty fortress, you gain the following benefits: 
 
• The spell requires no material component. • The fortress's walls and turrets are made from adamantine • Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the adamantine walls and turrets has an AC of 20 and 300 hit points per inch of thickness and is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from attacks not made with adamantine weapons. • The fortress only crumbles and sinks back into the ground if you cast the spell again, remaining even after 7 days.

Warlocks are spellcasters who gain arcane power not through study or innate talent, but by making dark deals with entities far beyond their understanding. Below are some examples of these otherworldly patrons in the world of Eberron. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 54 One celestial that is available to make pacts with is in fact the Silver Flame itself. While many warlocks of this pact are aware of the connection, calling themselves “silver pyromancers”, more are unaware of the connection to the Church of the Silver Flame or belong to esoteric sects that actually predate the modern Church. For these warlocks, the Celestial is a mystical battery of everlasting radiance that empowers them to bring light to dark places. Kalashtar are born with an inherent metaphysical tie to a quori spirit, a quori that rebelled against the darkness that rules Dal Quor. Kalashtar who meditate on their quori spirit intensely can forge a stronger connection to the immortal spirit, and form a pact with it, and gain the benefits of the Celestial pact as they use this stronger connection to meditate on the Path of Light. These kalashtar typically don't refer to themselves as "warlocks", but rather "atavists" (they typically also take one of the atavist kalashtar racial feats described in a later chapter). Kalashtar who form "atavist" pacts and who also select the Pact of the Blade feature are also typically known as "soulknives", and the blades they summon are visibly formed of psionic energy. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 55 In the world of Eberron, hexblade warlocks do not necessarily believe the source of their magic comes from an unusually powerful weapon. Rather, warlocks of the Pact of the Hexblade make deals with dangerous, shadowy entities of Mabar, the Endless Night. Such creatures are usually inimical to life and seek to spread death and destruction to the living. Hexblades with the Pact of the Blade feature take to calling their pact weapons "nightblades". When a warlock manifests one these nightblades, it usually appears as though the weapon's metal has been replaced with a dark, bladeshaped hole in reality, with an alien nightscape visible in its infinite depths. 
Unearthed Arcana: Warlock & Wizard, pg. 2 The Raven Queen appears to warlocks seeking to make pacts that give them power over death itself. The Raven Queen is said to be a powerful native of Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead, but no explorer of the planes has ever managed to locate her fabled winter citadel. At least, no one has ever returned from doing so.   Though the Raven Queen's identity remains a secret, the vast majority of her warlock beneficiaries are Seekers, worshipers of the Blood of Vol. Amongst those concerned about the dark practices of this religion, and knowledgeable about its history, there is a prevailing belief that the Raven Queen is somehow tied to the ancient elven line of Vol, from which the religion takes its name. 
Originally The Seeker Unearthed Arcana: The Faithful, pg. 1 Most warlocks who make pacts with The Archivist believe their patron to be none other than Aureon, the Sovereign of Law and Lore. Aureon is traditionally viewed as the basis for all knowledge, and as the Sovereign of Lore, he smiles on those who retrieve forgotten records and archive them, preserving knowledge for later generations. However, Aureon himself has never been proven to contact or converse with any of his pact benefactors. Most warlocks of the Pact of the Archivist may simply believe they are doing Aureon's work and make pacts with powerful entities that claim to be aligned with Aureon. Such entities include ancient dragons seeking lost branches of the Prophecy, immortal librarians of the Endless Library on the plane of Daanvi, or even a mysterious Inspired diplomat from Riedra, who seeks more information about the ancient Quori-Giant war. There are also persistent tales that the Archivist some warlocks make pacts with is not a being aligned with Aureon at all, but rather The Traveler. These warlocks supposedly require no intermediary, gaining their pact benefits directly from the god himself, who asks for little or nothing in return for making the pact. These warlocks wander Eberron in search of not old, lost lore, but rather new, untested, dangerous knowledge. 
, pg. 108 For millennia, the fey have kept their distance from mortal affairs, hiding behind veils and planar boundaries. Recently, however, the fabled Feyspires of lore have dropped these veils and have become startling reality for their neighbors. Your Archfey 

 
  
 
 
 
patron may be an Archfey native to Thelanis—such as the Prince of Frost—or it might be the Lord or Lady of one of these Feyspires: Pylas Pyrial, in Zilargo (between Korranberg and Trolanport in the Shimmerwood Forest) is called the Gate of Joy. Its population includes a majority of Feywild-native gnomes and has a cordial relationship with the Zil triumvirate. Shae Joridal, in the center of Darguun, is called the City of Emerald Lights. It is constantly under siege by the goblin military. Shae Lora Lyndar, in the Twilight Demesne of the Eldeen Reaches, is called the City of Rose and Thorn. Although on fair terms with the local druidic clans (especially the Greensingers), it is still wary of being permanently tied to the Material Plane. Shaelas Tiraleth, in the south of the Mournland, was called the Court of the Silver Tree. Explorers who venture into the Mournland have not yet explored the part of the Mournland near Valenar’s border to see how the Mourning has affected the Feyspire. Taer Lian Doresh, in the Whitepine Forest in the mainland of the Lhazaar Principalities, is called the Fortress of Fading Dreams. Its citizens are still adapting to the Principalities’ pirate society. Despite disturbing stories of nightmarish creatures roaming the woods, and strange sleepwalking communities, the Feyspire is on civil terms with High Prince Rygar. Taer Syraen, near the Scions Sound in Karrnwood in Karrnath, is called the Winter Citadel. It has a contentious relationship with the Karrnathi government, but a close one with House Phiarlan. 
, pg. 109 While archdevils are known to make deals and contracts in Eberron, a far more likely candidate for a fiendish patron are the demonic Overlords of the Lords of Dust. Each of these terrible beings has the personal might of a god, but with no interest in being worshiped. Instead they plan and scheme for their eventual release, after which they will end life on Eberron as we know it. There are roughly thirty Overlords in existence, below are just a few: Bel Shalor, the Shadow in the Flame, is a fiend that almost escaped his ancient bonds, but was stopped by Tira Miron and was trapped within the Silver Flame. Some say that he is still trapped within the flame in Flamekeep, able to whisper into the minds of the faithful. Eldrantulku, the Oathbreaker, is the spirit of discord and betrayal, turning allies into enemies. Katashka, the Gatekeeper, is the Overlord of life and death, and the creator of the first undead. 
Katashka's most renown servant was the archmage Kyuss, who he is said to have merged with in a failed bid to escape his bonds. Masvirik, the Cold Sun, is the Overlord with dominion over things that slither in the night. Masvirik is trapped deep beneath Haka'torvhak, where his servant Rhashaak and his dragonborn and lizardfolk tribes await his freedom. Rak Tulkhesh, the Rage of War, is the embodiment of the rage and bloodlust that drives mortals to war. The Overlord known only as The Scar That Abides once claimed rulership of all other Overlords. He was known for his hatred and spite, almost holy in its intensity. He is thought to be bound somewhere beneath Xen'drik. Sul Khatesh, the Keeper of Secrets, is the master of arcane might and mystery. Unknown to most, Sul Khatesh is trapped beneath the Arcane Congress, whispering to them in their sleep. Tiamat, the Daughter of Khyber, is the truest child of Khyber, and holds dominion over dragonkind. She is trapped within the Pit of Five Sorrows, where the Talons of Tiamat hope to free her. Tul Oreshka, the Truth in the Darkness, is the keeper of terrible truths. Truths that, once learned, shatter minds. The Horned Prince is worshiped by minotaurs, and represents the maze of savagery that, once entered into, is nearly impossible to emerge from. 
, pg. 109 Nine thousand years ago, the forces of madness incarnate besieged the known world. At the cost of civilizations, the masters of this horde of insanity were driven underground and sealed with ancient druidic magic. Nine thousand years later, these seals are weakening, and their guardians dwindling in number. Any of the great and terrible Daelkyr Princes still roaming the depths of Khyber could make for an excellent patron, as their influence and reach slowly extends beyond broken seals. Below are some of the known Daelkyr Princes: Belashyyra, the Lord of Eyes, who is said to be able to see through any mortal's eyes that has spoken his name. Some believe he is the creator of beholders and their kin. Dyrrn, the Corruptor, greatest general during the war and creator of the malformed dolgrims and dolgaunts from goblin and hobgoblin stock. Dyrrn is said to be trapped beneath the Eldeen Reaches and alleged to be responsible for the horrors that lurk in the deep woods. 
Kyrzin, the Prince of Slime, who left the world many "gifts" in the form of diseases that cause weeping pustules or even merely an abundance of mucus (such as the common cold). He is rumored to lurk beneath the Shadow Marches and sends his sentient oozes to haunt the swamps and bogs there. Orlassk, the Master of Stone, god and father to any creature capable of petrifying their foes (though the medusas vehemently deny a connection to this horrible creature). He is said to roam the depths of Khyber freely in a massive living gargoyle fortress. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 139 Restriction: Must be a worshiper of the Blood of Vol, or be a Khorvaire Elf, Aerenal Elf, Khoravar Half-Elf, or First-Generation Half-Elf that worships the Undying Court. Of the ancient beings on Eberron most concerned with the powers of death and immortality, none know more than the Undying Court or Erandis Vol. While Lady Vol will share her secrets with any faithful Seeker of proven enough worth, the Undying Court of Aerenal bestows blessings of knowledge, faith, or power only upon their living descendants. 
While artificers may be the masters of the practical application and engineering of magic, wizards remain the foremost theoreticians and masters of progressing the art of the arcane. In the world of Eberron, magical study is much more widespread, often taught in universities and institutions rather than passed down from one master to one apprentice. As such, while specialized wizard traditions still exist, it is just as likely that a developing wizard will choose a broader study of all the schools of magic. Below details such an arcane tradition. 
Generalist wizards are those mages that intentionally keep their study of arcane magic as broad as possible. They seek lore and knowledge from all schools and traditions of magic, so as to be prepared for anything. 
Starting at 2nd level, your broad study of every expression of arcane magic has honed your knowledge and expertise in all things arcane. You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it. 
At 2nd level, you record all the cantrips you know, plus three additional wizard cantrips of your choice, into your spellbook. Whenever you prepare spells, you select a number of wizard cantrips from your spellbook equal to the number in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table for your level. These selected cantrips are the only wizard cantrips you can cast until you prepare spells again. Whenever you would learn an additional wizard cantrip, you record it in your spellbook. Additionally, if you find a spell scroll containing a cantrip, or a cantrip recorded in another generalist wizard's spellbook, you may copy that cantrip to your spellbook as though it was a 1st level spell. 
When you reach 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level you can add two additional wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots when you add them, as shown on the Wizard table on page 113 of the . 
Beginning at 2nd level, you may use your spellbook as an arcane spellcasting focus. 
At 6th level, your arcane studies have increased your efficiency in casting a particular spell. Choose any 1st level spell in your spellbook that is not already a ritual. It is considered a ritual spell for you. 
At 10th level, you have attained a greater mastery of spell preparation. As a bonus action, you can replace one spell you have prepared with another spell from your spellbook. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest. 
At 14th level, your arcane studies have increased your efficiency in casting an even more potent spell. Choose any 3rd-level or lower spell in your spellbook that is not already a ritual. It is considered a ritual spell for you. 

 
  
 
 
 
While wizards who apply themselves to a broad study of arcane magic are abound in Eberron, study of specialized applications of magic are still quite common. Below are some suggestions on incorporating other arcane traditions into the world of Eberron. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 141 Aundair has a long and storied history of arcane traditions, and the Bladesingers of the Knights Arcane are among the most celebrated. Most members of the order are Eldritch Knights or swordmages, but a few that show exceptional talent in the mystic arts are trained as full Bladesingers instead.   Over the course of the Last War the secrets of Bladesinging have been gleaned by other nations, and Bladesingers can be found being trained by any of them. However, the Bladesingers of the Knights Arcane are the most celebrated and iconic among them. 
, pgs. 115–119 Several circles of wizardry exist in Khorvaire, each favoring a selection of schools of magic. Below are just a few: The Esoteric Order of Aureon is a highly respected organization of arcanists who are avowed to use their magic for the betterment of society. They allow wizards of all traditions to join their circle, but the Order has a predilection toward the schools of abjuration, divination, evocation, and transmutation. The Guild of Starlight and Shadows formed as an answer to the rigid structure and rules of the Esoteric Order and includes a number of bards and sorcerers as well as wizards. They consider the scholarly mages of the Esoteric Order to be pretentious old codgers, unwilling to push boundaries and explore the mystic arts. Wizards of this circle typically focus on conjuration, enchantment, illusion, and transmutation. The Closed Circle was a dark order of wizardry dedicated to the study of the lore of Khyber— especially the baleful magics of the daelkyr. The Esoteric Order of Aureon and the Guild of Starlight and Shadows joined forces with the Church of the Silver Flame and eradicated the Closed Circle nearly four centuries ago… but rumors persist that the knowledge of the Closed Circle wasn’t destroyed, merely hidden. While they were active, the wizards of the Closed Circle were known to specialize in conjuration, evocation, and transmutation. 
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, pg. 59 War Mages are trained all throughout the Five Nations. While the majority of wizards study ancient tomes and theorize about arcane philosophy, wizards who made a career serving in armies during the Last War were indeed mostly war mages, and tend to have a practical, utilitarian mindset when it comes to magic. Most see themselves as just another soldier and feel a common bond with others that fought for king and country.

layer characters in an Eberron campaign have a selection of options available to them. In this chapter, several Backgrounds, Spells, and optional Feats are presented. 
Several new backgrounds are detailed below for Eberron campaigns. Following these new options, some suggestions on including backgrounds from other sources are presented as well. 
First and foremost, you consider yourself a true scion of your homeland. The Five Nations are the oldest standing bastions of civilization in Khorvaire and possessed distinct cultural identities before, during, and now after the united Kingdom of Galifar. Even if you were not born in your country proper, but rather were raised in an ex-patriot community like those in Stormreach, your community continues the strong traditions of its motherland. After the Last War, the Five Nations were further divided by the Treaty of Thronehold into many different Sovereign nations. Though these countries have begun to have solidified their own national identities, most of them are too new or lawless to develop the kind of shared cultural experience that the Five Nations attained over a thousand years. Many citizens of these new nations still cling to the identity of their former parent nation, even if they don't realize it. Your background grants you equipment, plus skill, tool, and language proficiencies specific to the nation you consider your homeland. 
 
 
Equipment: Identification papers marking you as a citizen of your nation, one set of tools you are proficient with, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp. 
Although all citizens of a nation might share the same culture, they are individuals. Select the background feature of any other background listed in the . You gain that background feature.

Pre-War Five Nations 

  
You adhere to the teachings of a druidic tradition. While all druidic sects of the Eldeen Reaches revere the power of nature above all else, they each come to this belief from different roots. Though the leaders and teachers of these traditions are usually druids, their way of life is taught to any willing to learn. Rangers are common amongst the Eldeen sects, as well as fighters who develop their skills as scouts. Barbarians who follow the path of the totem warrior are also highly respected, for they are seen to channel the wrath of nature itself through their rages. With one exception, these druidic sects will even welcome arcane spellcasters amongst their number, for the aid and knowledge they bring to a community cannot be discounted. Though living one's life according to druidic tradition does not preclude worship of a deity, those with profound faith in a religion often come to understand nature through Arawai, Balinor, or the Devourer rather than the teachings of a sect. That said, it is not unheard of the find paladins who've taken the oath of the ancients or clerics who venerate the abstract force of nature itself to be found in a Eldeen sect. No matter the path by which an aspirant came to their chosen sect, they must be taught the secret druidic language. Only through this ancient tongue can the secrets of nature be revealed. 
 
Skill Proficiencies: Nature and one skill appropriate to your druidic sect noted below. Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism kit Languages: Druidic (As the class feature on page 66 of the ) Equipment: A skinning knife, an Herbalism kit, a trophy from an animal you killed, and a set of traveler's clothes. 
Though all druids in the Eldeen Reaches can trace their traditions back to the Scaled Apostate, their philosophies have diverged in the roll of years since that ancient history. Here are some of the major druidic sects that can be found today. The Ashbound. The Ashbound believe that civilization is harmful, and that it has produced the worst abomination to the natural order possible: arcane magic. They do not allow arcane spellcasters to become aspirants, and in fact are fanatical in their goal to see such people punished and their magical works destroyed. The Ashbound believe that the Day of 
Mourning was caused by arcane magic run amok, and blame wizards, artificers, and the like for the disgusting blight on the world that is the Mournland. Ashbound initiates are trained in Arcana, to better recognize and target arcanists, artifacts, and magic items. The Children of Winter. Winter is the time of year when death covers the land. This sect, while not wholly evil, rarely has good-aligned aspirants, as they view the death of the weak and pitiful to be nature's due course. Mercy is a crime to the Children of Winter, and the brutal cycle of predator and prey their ideal. aspirants to the Children of Winter must be proficient in Survival, for they must provide for themselves. Those who can't simply starve. The Gatekeepers. The oldest sect of druidism on Khorvaire, the Gatekeepers have grown fewer and fewer in number as their teachings lost relevance. Still, they insist on the absolute necessity of maintaining their ancient seals, warding the natural world from extraplanar threats and imprisoning the horrors of a long-forgotten war within Khyber. While Gatekeeper aspirants are fewer and farther between than they once were, they are all trained in Arcana, to better identify and maintain the Gatekeeper's protective barriers and track planar movements. The Greensingers. The Greensingers are an intensely capricious druidic sect, embodying the unfathomable whims of nature. A pleasant summer day can quickly devolve into a cacophonous downpour beneath a roaring sky of thunder clouds, only for golden rays of sunlight to pierce the darkness of the storm and herald a rainbow on the horizon. So too, do the Greensingers live. With a strong tie to fey and the plane of Thelanis, the Greensingers do not accept any "lay" members among their number, only teaching their ways to those capable of spellcasting, especially arcane spellcasters like fey-pact warlocks and wildmagic sorcerers. The Greensingers’ philosophy is too wild and unpredictable to truly "train" any initiates, but all who manage to follow their path eventually become proficient with Deception, to match the beguiling and fickle nature of their peers. The Wardens of the Wood. The single largest druidic sect on Khorvaire, the Wardens of the Wood believe in the sincere stewardship of the land. They see the stone structures and wooden homes of cities to be the natural habitat of the common races and embrace the progress and technology of civilized culture. Their efforts to protect nature revolve around the hunting of unnatural creatures, such as monstrosities and fiends, and educating others on responsible cultivation and harvesting of nature's bounty. Warden aspirants are trained in Athletics to ensure their physical prowess, 

 
as the Wardens are capable of fielding an army to rival one of the Five Nations, and all aspirants must be able to serve as soldiers if need be. 
You can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth. In addition, as long as you can see the sun or stars, you are always able to discern which direction is true north. 
 
Aspirants to druidic traditions are shaped by their bond with nature, and how their sect focuses this bond. Important sites or relics to the Gatekeepers would be very different from those sacred to the Children of Winter. Those following the Ashbound would probably lean closer to evil ideals and fanatical flaws. 
 
 
d8 Personality Trait 1 I idolize a particular hero of my druidic sect, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example. 2 I once sprinted twenty-five miles without stopping to warn my druid circle of an approaching horde of aberrant beasts. I'd do it again if I had to. 3 I see omens in every event and action. Nature speaks to us always, we just need to listen. 4 I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear. 5 I quote (or misquote) proverbs and druidic aphorisms in almost every situation. 6 I am tolerant (or intolerant) of the worship of gods of nature. 7 I was, in fact, raised by wolves. 8 I've spent so long in the wilderness that I have little practical experience dealing with people who live in cities and towns. 
 
 
d6 Ideal 1 Tradition. The ancient traditions of druidism and nature must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful) 2 Change. We must help bring about the change that nature demands in the world. (Chaotic) 3 Conviction. I will do whatever it takes to purify this world, no matter the cost. (Evil) 4 Compassion. I will always try to help those in need, no mater what the personal cost. (Good) 5 Ambition. I hope to one day rise up and become a renown member of my druidic sect. (Any) 6 Determination. Nothing and no one can steer me away from my higher calling. (Any) 
 
 
d6 Bond 1 The brother and sister aspirants I began my studies with are the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me. 2 A blight upon the unspoiled reaches of the wild is a blight upon my soul. 3 I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it. 4 I would die to recover an ancient relic of my druidic sect that was lost long ago. 5 I owe my life to the druid who took me in when my parents died. 6 I fled from civilization long ago, escaping into the wilderness to hide from those that may yet still hunt me. I must someday confront them. 
 
 
d6 Flaw 1 I put too much trust in those who wield power within my druidic sect. 2 I am inflexible in my thinking. 3 I am suspicious of those who live life disconnected from the wilderness and expect the worst of them. 4 I secretly long for the vices and comfort of the city, especially hard drink. 5 Violence is my answer to almost any challenge. Survival of the fittest is nature's decree. 6 My hatred of nature's enemies is blind and unreasoning.

The Dragonmarked families control much of industry and commerce among the Thronehold Nations of Khorvaire. However, they would not be the economic powerhouses that they are if they only allowed blood relations to work for them. Each house has one or two major guilds that controls much of a certain trade. Some of these guilds rely on the power of Dragonmarks and only those with the appropriate Mark can join the guild—and may in fact be expected to by their family. However, several more employ and train all those interested in learning the trade and working diligently. Below is a list of Houses, their guilds, and what languages and proficiencies they grant their members. 
Equipment: A set of calligrapher's supplies or one tool your guild grants proficiency in, Identification papers marking you as a member of the guild (or Dragonmarked House if you are a blood relative), a set of common or traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp. 
As an established member of a House guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary and pay for your funeral if needed. In most major cities and towns in Thronehold Nations, a House Enclave offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, 
 
 
allies, or hirelings. The Dragonmarked Houses, and to a lesser extent their guild's, wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to influential political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers. If you are not a blood relative of the House a guild is owned by, you must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces. 
The Guild Artisan's suggested characteristics on page 133 of the are particularly fitting for House Guild members. 
 
If you are a related to the House by blood or marriage, you may have graduated from your House's guilds to join the core organization of the House itself. 
 
Skill Proficiencies: You retain the skills and training from your guild days, but now you are one of the movers and shakers of your family. Due to a life of playing the social game of high society, you may substitute one or more of your guild's skill proficiencies for proficiency with up to two of the following skills: Deception, Insight, Intimidate, or Persuasion. Equipment: You have a set of fine clothes instead of common or traveler's clothes, and you may substitute the set of tools for 50 additional gold. 
As long as you remain in contact with your House's upper echelons, you have access to influential political figures directly through the House and need not donate money or magic items to gain an audience with them. Furthermore, the House supports you with a wealthy lifestyle at no cost to yourself. These perks come with a cost, however. As your influence grows, the requests for favors start to go both ways. If you decline a request or fail to keep a promise, you may find yourself quickly ostracized. Too many shirked responsibilities may find you excoriated. 
 
 
While you may still find the Guild Artisan's characteristics fitting, the Noble's suggested characteristics on pages 135 and 136 of the work particularly well for a Dragonmark Heir, with the understanding that the power and influence you have over the common people is a privilege of economic standing, rather than noble blood. 
 
Excoriates are members of a Dragonmarked family that have been cast out of the House. Whether through some transgression or crime, you are persona non grata to all Dragonmarked family members and are barred from their estates and doing business with them. However, you still know the lessons your family taught you. You can pick your proficiencies from either your guild's skill proficiencies or those available to House Scions. However, you must select a background benefit from another background, as you can no longer rely on political or economic support from your former family. For example, down-on-their luck excoriates may fall in with the wrong crowd and gain the Criminal Contact background benefit, or another might turn their back on civilization entirely, gaining the background benefit from Hermit or Outlander. 
 
  
The country you grew up in, the lifestyle you led, the job you had before setting out to become an adventurer, none were quite so important to you as your faith in the Sovereign Host. As a vassal, you may not be rigorously religious, like adherents of the Church of the Silver Flame are, and may not be classically trained in religious studies, but you still believe that all life flows from the Sovereigns. In every swing of a master smith's hammer, there is Onatar. In every sunrise, there is Dol Arrah. In every city wall, standing strong, there is Boldrei. The Sovereigns are all around you, and you draw comfort in them. Vassals may venerate the Host as a whole, but usually find themselves gravitating to one or two Sovereigns in particular. Your background grants you equipment, plus skill and tool proficiencies specific to a Sovereign that speaks to you particularly clearly. 
 
Equipment: A holy symbol (either to the Host as a whole, or one customized to a particularly favorite Sovereign who influences you most), one set of tools this background gives you proficiency with, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp. 
 
 
Sovereign Skills Tools Arawai Nature, Medicine Herbalism kit, Weaver’s tools Aureon Arcane, Religion Calligrapher’s set, Alchemist’s supplies Balinor Animal Handling, Survival Herbalism kit, Leatherworker’s tools Boldrei Insight, Investigate Carpenter’s tools, Mason’s tools Dol Arrah Athletics, Insight Cartographer’s tools, one type of gaming set Dol Dorn Athletics, Intimidate Vehicles (land), one type of gaming set Kol Korran Insight, Persuasion Jeweler’s tools, Navigator’s tools Olladra Medicine, plus Performance or Sleight of Hand Two of the following: Cook’s utensils, one kind of gaming set, one kind of musical instrument Onatar Arcana, History Two of the following: Carpenter’s tools, Mason’s tools, Potter’s tools, Smith’s tools, Woodcarver’s tools 
Vassals come from a great many varied backgrounds. As your background feature, you select the background benefit that corresponds to a particular Sovereign. These background benefits belong to the backgrounds detailed in the . Your choice of Sovereign does not necessarily need to be the same one that granted you your background proficiencies, because as a vassal you feel that all the Sovereigns influence your life greatly at some point or another. 
 
 
Sovereign Feature (Background) Arawai Wanderer (Outlander*) or Discovery (Hermit*) Aureon Researcher (Sage*) or Discovery (Hermit) Balinor Wanderer (Outlander*) Boldrei Rustic Hospitality (Folk Hero) Dol Arrah Military Rank (Soldier*) Dol Dorn Military Rank (Soldier*) or Gladiator (Variant Entertainer) Kol Korran City Secrets (Urchin) or Ship’s Passage (Sailor) Olladra By Popular Demand (Entertainer*) Onatar Guild Membership (Guild Artisan*) 
 
If a background noted in parenthesis in the Vassal Background Feature table has an asterisk next to it, it is particularly fitting to use the noted background as the basis for your personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Otherwise, the feature is the most relevant part of the background, and the background's traits, ideals, bonds and flaws are not common among Vassals of that god. Feel free to use another background to determine those qualities in such a case. 
 
 
 
You might profess to be a Vassal in public, but secretly you venerate the darker side of the pantheon. While the Dark Six themselves are almost all evil, not everyone who seeks their favor is. Many sailors openly call to Arawai for a safe journey, but secretly pray to The Devourer to forestall his wrath. Likewise, a smith tired of mastering the same old pattern of armor may seek a gift of inspiration from The Traveler in order to create something innovative (though one should always, always beware the gifts of The Traveler). Select from the following tables for your cultist proficiencies and background benefits. 
 
 
Dark God Skills Tools The Devourer Nature, Intimidate Navigator’s tools, Carpenter’s tools The Fury Persuasion, Intimidate Painter’s supplies, one kind of musical instrument The Keeper History, Religion Forgery kit, one type of gaming set The Mockery Athletics, Deception Disguise kit, Poisoner’s kit The Shadow Arcana, Intimidate Alchemist’s supplies, Calligrapher’s tools The Traveler Deception, Persuasion Two of the following: Disguise kit, Forgery kit, Thieves’ tools, or one kind of artisan’s tools 
 
 
Sovereign Feature (Background) The Devourer Wanderer (Outlander*) or Ship's Passage (Sailor or Pirate*) The Fury By Popular Demand (Entertainer*) The Keeper Researcher (Sage) The Mockery Criminal Contact (Criminal or Spy*) or Military Rank (Soldier*) The Shadow Discovery (Hermit) or Researcher (Sage) The Traveler Discovery (Hermit) or False Identity (Charlatan*)  
While the above are new backgrounds specific to Eberron, and the backgrounds detailed in the are broad enough to be applicable to any campaign setting, below are suggestions for incorporating backgrounds from other sources into your Eberron character’s history. 
Tomb of Annihilation, pg. 191 With a diverse array of cultures and peoples all across Khorvaire and beyond, anthropology is a fascinating field of study in the world of Eberron. When rolling for or selecting your adopted culture, use the following table instead of the one detailed in Tomb of Annihilation: 
 
 
d20 Culture 1 Adaran Monks 2 Aerenal Elves 3 Akiak Dwarves and Duergar 4 Darguun Goblinoids 5 Droaam 6 The Eldeen Druidic Sects 7 The Empire of Riedra 8 The Feyspires 9 Ghaash’kala Orcs 10 Guardians of Rushemé 11 Kalashtar 12 Mror Dwarves 13 Sahuagin of the Thunder Sea 14 Scales of Q’barra 15 Seren Barbarians 16 Shadow Marches clans 17 Talenta Halflings 18 Valenar Elves 19 Vulkoori Drow 20 Zilargo  In addition, consider allowing this background to grant proficiency in Glyphbook sets (detailed in Chapter 4: Equipment) and providing a glyphbook set as starting equipment, in place of a second language this background would usually grant. 
Tomb of Annihilation, pg. 192 The ruins of many an ancient culture—from the Dhakaani Empire of Khorvaire, to the Qabalrin of Xen’drik—have left their mark on the world of Eberron. As an archaeologist, you seek to uncover the true history of these long-lost cultures, sifting through 
 
  
myth and legend to find the facts. Most archeologists in Eberron are employed by an institution of higher learning, such as Morgrave University or the Library on Korranberg. 
Originally Waterdhavian Noble Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 154 This background is a viable alternative to the noble background presented in the , though perhaps a more pampered and spoiled one. This lends the background the air of an urban socialite. However, Waterdeep and the North are not locations that exist in Eberron. Instead, for your Kept in Style background feature, choose a nation and a city within that nation for the locations the feature allows you to live in comfort, such as Sharn in Breland or Fairhaven in Aundair. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 145 The city watch background fits perfectly into Eberron with nearly no adjustments. The variant, investigator, is instead known as an “inquisitive” in Eberron, and substitutes one language for proficiency in the Inquisitive's kit (detailed in Chapter 4: Equipment). A background as an inquisitive is suitable for characters who lent their talents to the city watch, or worked for a Dragonmarked House such as Tharashk or Medani with licensed inquisitive offices, or were part of a private inquisitive agency. Inquisitives may also substitute the set of manacles in the background’s starting equipment for an Inquisitive's kit. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 146 The courtier fits into Eberron completely as-is. Keep in mind the courtier grants you access to noble courts and government officials. The House scion variant of the House guild member background would be the equivalent background for a character similarly connected to the Dragonmarked Houses. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 147 The faction agent background is a perfect fit for the intrigue-laden world of Eberron. However, the factions presented in the Sword Coast Adventuring Guide do not exist in Eberron. If you select this background, select one of the below factions instead: The Argentum. Restriction: Must worship the Church of the Silver Flame. This covert faction is a branch of the Church of the Silver Flame, tasked with identifying, locating, and obtaining powerful or 
dangerous artifacts—by any means necessary. The Argentum has carried out this mandate for centuries, and this talent for covert operations made it the logical choice to become Thrane's intelligence service when the Last War denied Flamekeep access to the King's Citadel. It is a small, specialized organization that has been operating for centuries and is highly skilled at procurement and extraction, and has access to the warehouse of dangerous artifacts its gathered over the centuries. Most of the artifacts the Argentum hunts are of a religious nature, either pertaining to the Silver Flame or dark cults devoted to vile entities. Being able to identify these artifacts is of the highest priority to an agent of the Argentum, leading to their extensive training in Religion. The Aurum. Outwardly, the Aurum is merely a fraternal society of wealthy individuals, professing an interest in history. And though most Khorvarians suspect that members of the Aurum conduct special deals and grant political favors amongst their number, the true reach of the conspiracy remains unknown— even to you. The Aurum is stratified into many layers, circles within circles of inner secrets. As an agent of the Aurum, you may serve only a lowly guildmaster on the Copper Concord, or may have the trust of a secretive Mror clan master in the Gold Concord. One day, you may hope to earn the right to wear the rings of the Copper Concord, and possibly work your way up to Platinum, but for now you must enact the deals and missions your patron sends you on. Agents of the Aurum Concords must be trained in Deception, to ensure their masters plans are hidden and secret. The King's Dark Lanterns. Restriction: Must be native to Breland. The Dark Lanterns serve the crown of Breland as spies and assassins. Collectively they form the intelligence division of the King's Citadel, a much larger organization sworn to defend Breland from its enemies and dispense justice in the name of King Boranel. More than any other division within the Citadel, the Dark Lanterns tend toward intelligencegathering missions that extend beyond Breland's borders. As the secret servants of the crown, members of the organization are granted the authority to conduct intelligence operations on foreign soil, execute covert missions across the continent, and prevent national secrets from falling into the hands of rival intelligence agencies. The Dark Lanterns also have the unwritten authority to eliminate any creature that threatens their nation, its sovereign, or its citizens. While individual Dark Lanterns may execute their duties through a variety of methods (subterfuge, forgery, stealth), all are trained in Investigate to find clues, make deductions, and find information swiftly and accurately. 

 
The Library of Korranberg. The oldest, most famous, and most exhaustively curated library in the known world is the great Library of Korranberg. Procurement officers for the Library are tasked with seeking out tomes and knowledge of some kind or another; whatever esoteric bit of lore the staff of curators has deemed the Library requires for its extensive shelves. Field agents such as these are trained in History, to better identify the pedigree of their target tomes. Order of the Emerald Claw. Restriction: Must worship the Blood of Vol. Disavowed by King Kaius III, the Order of the Emerald Claw is now a fanatical criminal organization. They rarely operate in secret, however, proud of their beliefs and confident in their strength. As such, most "knights" of the Emerald Claw rely on Intimidation to secure cooperation from locals not sympathetic to their cause. The Royal Eyes of Aundair. Restriction: Must be native to Aundair. When Queen Aundair the First became the first crowned governor of the nation named for her—over a thousand years—she immediately set about building her own intelligence network. Rather than placing her trust in her siblings and the King's Citadel (which had its headquarters and leadership based in her sister Brey's nation of Breland), Queen Aundair trusted in her own servants and wizards instead. The Royal Eyes of Aundair were formed to be Aundair's arcane spies. The modern Royal Eyes are almost uniformly spellcasters, especially learned in divination magic, but all of their operatives are trained in Arcana regardless of magical ability. The Trust. Restriction: Must be a gnome and native to Zilargo. The Trust was formed by the Triumvirate, the governing body of Zilargo, to police and protect gnomish interests. No one is exactly sure how many agents of the Trust there are, but given that Zilargo has the lowest crime rate on Khorvaire, the answer seems to be "enough". Though agents don't know for certain which among their neighbors is another agent, they are invariably trained in Perception, ever watchful for any nefarious wrongdoing in the community. The Twelve. Restriction: Must be related to a Dragonmarked House by blood or marriage. An arcane institution funded by the Dragonmarked Houses, the Twelve represents inter-house cooperation, working together to study dragonmarks and find ever more useful applications for them. Over the centuries of its existence, the institute has been responsible for many arcane advances, such as airships, speaking stones, and the lightning rail. While the wizards, artificers, and magewrights of the Twelve do much of the research, it is still an organization comprised of individuals with 
their own loyalties to their House or even their own pet projects. Many of the Twelve's gifted mages are skilled in Persuasion, or employ attendants similarly trained, to facilitate the application of funds from the Twelve's budget to their grand ideas over another's. The Wayfinder Foundation. Founded by Lord Boroman ir'Dayne, the Wayfinder Foundation is an exclusive organization that invites only renown explorers and adventurers to join its number as full members. The guild funds dangerous expeditions to exotic locales such as the Frostfell, Xen'drik, and the Seren Isles, seeking to unlock the mysteries of the unknown. Though the position of full member is invitation only, these expeditions require many hands, and even the greenest of recruits is thoroughly trained in Survival, to help ensure the success of every expedition. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 148 The world of Eberron is vast and host to many cultures and strange lands, allowing you to play an exotic foreigner if you so wish. However, the possible homelands listed in the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide do not exist in Eberron. Instead, see below for your character's possible land of origin: The Demon Wastes. This blasted wasteland on the very northwest edge of Khorvaire extends beyond the Shadowcrags and Icehorn mountain range. Life in the Demon Wastes is harsh and brutal. Savage tribes roam the canyons and cracked plains, vying for what little resources there are to sustain themselves, praying to strange, unheard of gods. The fell magic of ruined demonic cities permeates the landscape, leading to odd superstitions and survival skills that may seem bizarre or foolish to outsiders. The orc clans of the Ghaash'kala pray to a burning effigy and insist that palpable evil taints all those who set foot in the Demon Wastes, even themselves, and so must not be allowed to leave. Sarlona. Once a continent of many varying cultures, a thousand years of Inspired rule have homogenized the continent of Sarlona into the Empire of Riedra. An orderly, feudal society of rigid castes and absolute loyalty to the Inspired. The only resistance to Inspired rule lies in the mountains of Adar, where spiritual hermits and Kalashtar refugees have weathered a thousand-year siege. Whether Riedran or Adaran, the inhabitants of Sarlona have existed in near isolation from Khorvaire for nearly three millennia, leading to many exotic differences in culture and outlook (such as the Sarlonan prevalence of psionics and their lack of arcane or divine magic.) Sarlonan fashions tend to display long flowing robes with 

  
colorful, linear patterns over dark fabric, with a prevalence of crystal jewelry. The Seren Isles. Argonnessen, the land of dragons, remains a mystery to the rest of the world of Eberron. Every expedition into the interior of the continent has either been lost, or rebuffed on the shores of the Seren Isles where savage tribes worship dragons as gods. These tribesmen live by raiding and pillaging, supplemented by hunting, fishing, and gathering. Serens offer sacrifices to their dragon gods, and their greatest warriors take on dragon totems that they believe grant them great powers. Xen'drik. The Shattered Land is a vast wilderness of the unknown. The few maps of Xen'drik show large swathes of jungle and desert, but are incredibly unreliable. Though the scorpion tribes of the Vulkori drow are the most well-known natives of Xen'drik, residents of Khorvaire could not even begin to fathom the depth and breadth of cultures that might exist within the mysteries of this broken continent. 
Curse of Strahd, pg. 209 Any number of terrible events can befall a person in the world of Eberron, so the haunted one background has its place in the world if you are seeking to inject a bit of noir horror into your backstory. In addition to the Harrowing Events listed in Curse of Strahd, you may also elect to have one of the following as your harrowing event: War Crime. You witnessed or perhaps even participated in a war crime against innocents during the Last War. The memory of what you saw or did will haunt you till the end of your days. The Day of Mourning. You were there. You don’t know how you survived. Something unspeakable spared you while all you loved and held dear was reduced to ash and whispers. You must know why. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 150 This background fits well into Eberron with one caveat: you cannot inherit a tattoo, as this would be confusingly similar to magical dragonmarks. Rather, the kind of body marking you inherit if you roll or select option 8 on the Inheritance table is a striking physical feature, such as a glowing red eye, or a silver hand. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 151 Eberron has its fair share of knightly orders, allowing you to select this background in an Eberron campaign. However, the orders presented in the Sword Coast 
Adventurer's Guide do not exist in Eberron. Instead, select an order presented below, or create your own. The Knights Arcane. Restriction: Must possess arcane spellcasting ability and be proficient with at least one martial weapon. The best of Aundair's best are the Knights Arcane, an elite knightly order of soldiers boasting both martial skill and arcane ability. Universally trained in Arcana, these Knights Arcane were singularly important to Aundair's war effort during the Last War, keeping that nation's comparatively small armies in the fight with spell and blade. Within the Knights Arcane, the order of the Knights Phantom exists as the elite of the elite, a cadre of dragoons (or mounted infantry), who executed many a daring rescue by charging into flanking enemy positions on their conjured phantom steeds. The King's Citadel. The King's Citadel exists to serve the crown ruler of Breland and protect the nation's people. Divided into the King's Swords, the King's Wands, the King's Shield, and the more secretive King's Dark Lanterns, many talented and capable individuals were elevated to knighthood during the Last War in order to serve in the King's Citadel. Now that the war is over, the King's Citadel has been charged with law enforcement across Breland. Agents of the Citadel travel throughout the nation, trained in Investigate in order to dispense the King’s justice while serving as the eyes, ears, and strong right arm of the crown. The Knights of Thrane. King Thalin ir'Wynarn was the last royal to wear Thrane's crown, and when he died in 914 YK, a popular uprising turned the people against his heir Prince Daslin. The Knights of Thrane were beholden to the throne and Daslin above all else, and stood ready to defend their prince with their lives. However, Daslin refused to allow any bloodshed, and abdicated his inheritance, ushering in the theocracy of the Church of the Silver Flame. Though many knights refused to accept anything but Wynarn rule and exiled themselves to Stormreach, many more accepted the Prince's decision and remained loyal to Wynarn blood, even though they also now serve the Church. The Knights of Thrane train all their inductees in History, ensuring that all future Knights of Thrane know where their true loyalties lie. The Knights of Purification. Restriction: Must worship the Silver Flame. Comprised of deeply devout Silver Flame worshipers, the Knights of Purification have a singular goal: the eradication of evil cults. Knights Purifiers are trained in Religion to better identify the rites of and practices of malicious covens and secret brotherhoods, and are then tasked with investigating these cults and shining a holy light on their depravities. The Knights of Purification were 

 
  
 
 
 
thrust into the spotlight for their controversial acts which ended in the death of a cardinal, though the Knights Purifiers were ultimately exonerated of any wrongdoing when evidence was discovered exposing the cardinal for a heretic, guilty of sacrificing innocent citizens in blood rituals. The Order of Rekkenmark. For almost a thousand years, the best military officers in Galifar graduated from Karrnath's Rekkenmark Academy and joined the Order of Rekkenmark. During the Last War, members of the Order led Karrnath's armies to victory time and again, often against daunting odds. Even in a time of peace, the opal ring that marks a member of the Order earns more respect from veteran soldiers than a dozen medals. All members of the Order are experts in History, studying extensively on past wartime campaigns and important battles. The Order of the Onyx Skull. The first knightly order of Karrnath to truly embrace the presence of the undead, the Order of the Onyx Skull trained many of the officers that were charged with giving orders to units of Karrnathi undead during the Last War. This required an extensive training in Religion to be able to replicate the Blood of Vol rites for commanding them. The terrifying Bone Knights of Karrnath also exclusively draw their number from the Order of the Onyx Skull. 
Originally Uthgart Tribe Member Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 153 The Uthgart tribes do not exist in Eberron, but the features of this background lend themselves to the tough frontier settlers of the Eldeen Reaches and the Shadow Marches. The Uthgart Heritage feature is modified to become either "Marcher Heritage" or "Reacher Heritage" and apply to either of these territories instead of "the North". In addition, nomadic groups of nature-loving elves, the Harpers, and gods of the "First Circle" do not exist in Eberron, so the only folk allied with your tribe are likely to be druidic circles or Khyber cults, depending on your tribe's beliefs and history. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 152 The Last War was a very active time for mercenaries. Companies rose and fell over the century-long conflict, and were responsible for some of the most influential events in the Last War. While the mercenary companies detailed in the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide do not exist in Eberron, below are a few of the myriad mercenary companies found on Khorvaire. 
Bronze Hawk. One of the largest non-goblinoid mercenary companies employed by Cyre after the Darguul companies betrayed them, the Bronze Hawk frequently saw action on the Cyre-Karrnath front. Caught there on the Day of Mourning, only half the company survived the rushing expanse of the deadgrey mists. Today, the Bronze Hawk seems obsessed with finding these lost companions, and are said to be among the greatest experts on the twisted Mournland. Whispers circulate that even these survivors were scarred—mentally, physically, or both—by the magic of the Mourning. Caerlyn's Blade. Restriction: Must be a Valenar elf. During the Last War, Caerlyn's Blade earned great renown by aiding the Brelish evacuation of its western lands, riding into battle against ogres and trolls with deadly skill. Today, they are currently based in Sharn, and often sell their services to the King's Citadel, continuing their love of fighting giant-sized enemies by striking out against Droaam forces encroaching on the Brelish border in the Graywall Mountains. Cyre's Scourge. Restriction: Must be a goblinoid. This company's former name has been lost since the day of Haruuc’s rebellion. Formerly a greatly respected mercenary company in Cyran employ, the Scourge single-handedly slew an entire garrison of elite Cyran troops in their sleep. This garrison was stationed on the Cyre-Karrnath battlefront, so the blame for the ensuing massacre of thousands of Cyran troops was also squarely placed on the Scourge's shoulders. To this day, the members of Cyre's Scourge are held as paragons of goblinoid loyalty in Darguun. Dagger of Valaes Tairn. Restriction: Must be a Valenar elf proficient with the Stealth skill. While most Valenar warbands are eager to spread their glory and renown across the continent, the Dagger of Valaes Tairn remain a mystery to most outside of Valenar. The Dagger doesn't accept unsolicited contracts and do not advertise their services in a straightforward manner. Instead, they take it upon themselves to eliminate known rivals of one faction or another, then demand payment for the service. Most "beneficiaries" of these favors have found it far more prudent to comply than refuse. The Dagger of Valaes Tairn trains its members in the most cunning guerrilla tactics known to the Tairnadal. As the warband's leader, Illidris Kayael, says, "Enemy arrows, enemy eyes. Let either find you, and you die." The Fog Riders. Restriction: Must be a goblinoid. Known as the "Avrak Sehn" in their own tongue, the Fog Riders were employed by Breland during the Last War as a forward reconnaissance force for the mobile fortress Argonth. They attained great fame within Breland for a daring rescue of General Allusair Connol, 

 
 
 
  
one of Breland's greatest generals and close personal friend of King Boranex. Some say this heroic action was what ultimately caused Breland to support Darguun's claim of sovereignty when the Thronehold Accords were signed. Manifest Legion. Restriction: Must have arcane spellcasting ability. The Manifest Legion has roots dating back before the Last War, but truly came into its own during that conflict. Originally founded in 888 YK by a group of Aundarian wizards expelled from the Arcane Congress for providing military aid without approval, the Manifest Legion embraced their newfound freedom and business model. Today, the Manifest Legion remains the largest independent arcane military force in the Five Nations. The Legion takes its name from the prevalent use of conjuration spells that summon spirits into corporeal form, such as conjure fey or conjure elementals. Though fresh recruits are not capable of casting these spells, the Manifest Legion ensures that they are available for study (and copying into spellbooks, if necessary) for any member who gains the level of ability necessary to do so. Red Gauntlet Regiment. Restriction: Must have a non-evil alignment. A famed mercenary company, the Red Gauntlet Regiment has existed for centuries, its fortunes rising and falling with the governments and churches it supports. Minstrels across Khorvaire sing folk tales praising the Red Gauntlet and the code of honor it regards as essential to the soldier's life. Once the Red Gauntlet is hired, it stays hired, and no pay-off by the enemy is great enough to sully its given word. In the latter years of the Last War, the Red Gauntlet served the Brelish crown with distinction along the Breland-Cyre border. On the Day of Mourning, the Red Gauntlet is said to have "formally requested" to be ordered to help the evacuation of Cyran troops and refugees fleeing the dead-grey mists, and thus earned the personal respect of not only King Boranel, but the Cyran refugees lead by Prince Oragev in New Cyre. 
Originally Cloistered Scholar Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 146 The cloistered scholar background provides the proficiencies and features to play an adventuring professor in Eberron. See the description for complex libraries found in this book’s Equipment chapter, and select a library for your background feature, or ask your DM for more ideas about which institution you are in the employ of. 
Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, pg. 153 The necessity for bounty hunters exists in Eberron, ensuring this background has a place in the world. House Tharashk's more adventurous heirs often employ their Mark of Finding in this line of work, and the Sentinel Marshals of House Deneith can be seen as the most prestigious form of bounty hunter. Still others operate privately, supporting themselves in this dangerous line of work. 
 
 

 
  
 
 
 
These new spells are presented in alphabetical order. 
1st-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer, Wizard Make a melee spell attack against a warforged, construct, or object you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d12 force damage. This spell has no effect on any other type of creature. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st. 
1st-level conjuration (ritual) Casting Time: 1 hour Range: 10 feet Components: V, S, M (A small khybershard worth 50 gp, which the elemental mote coalesces around. If the mote drops to 0 hit points, the khybershard is burned out and becomes worthless) Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer, Wizard You summon a minor elemental spirit of air, earth, fire, or water and bind it to the khybershard, creating an elemental mote that serves you (for the statistics of each type of elemental mote, see Appendix A). While the elemental mote is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. The elemental mote acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. The elemental mote cannot normally attack, however when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your elemental mote to make one attack of its own as a Reaction. The elemental mote can take other actions as normal. When the elemental mote drops to 0 hit points, the khybershard at its center burns out, releasing the elemental spirit back to its home plane. A burned out khybershard becomes worthless. As an action, you can temporarily suppress an elemental mote. Its elemental essence disappears completely into the khybershard at its center (which drops to the ground if it is not within your reach), where the elemental spirit awaits your command to restore it. Alternatively, you can dismiss the binding of the elemental spirit to the khybershard altogether, 
sending the spirit back to its home plane. Doing so also burns out the khybershard and renders it worthless. As an action, you can hurl a khybershard with a suppressed elemental spirit inside of it up to 30 feet away from you into an unoccupied space and restore it to elemental mote form. You can't have more than one elemental mote at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have an elemental mote serving you, you cannot use the previous elemental mote's khybershard as the focus for the new spell, and when you finish casting, the previous elemental mote's spirit is released back to its home plane and renders its khybershard worthless. 
1st-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: 60 feet Components: V Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer, Wizard A warforged, construct, or object of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on any other type of creature. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a slot of 2nd level or higher, the hit points restored increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. 
6th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer, Wizard Choose a warforged or construct you can see within range. You reach out to the magical animating force of the target and enhance it, repairing the target’s functions to superlative levels, causing the target to regain 70 hit points. This spell also ends blindness and deafness affecting the target. This spell has no effect on any other type of creature. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of hit points repaired increases by 10 for each slot level above 6th. 
 
 

 
 
 
  
Evocation cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: S, M (a wand suitable for us as an arcane focus worth 10 gp) Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer As you cast this spell you imbue the wand you hold with a single charge of magic, then discharge it in a blast of energy toward the one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 damage. The spell can inflict acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, piercing, psychic, radiant, or thunder damage; when you first learn this cantrip, you choose two damage types and when you cast the spell, you choose which damage type available to you to use. The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). At each of these levels, you may also select an additional damage type to add to your repertoire. 
Transmutation cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer You touch a dying warforged or a construct that has 5 or less hit points. The target immediately enters an inert state, becoming stable if dying, and incapacitated indefinitely. If the target regains any hit points or is damaged, the insert state ends. 
3rd-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: 60 feet Components: V Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer, Wizard As you shout arcane words, up to six warforged, constructs, or objects of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on any other type of creature. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a slot of 4th level or higher, the hit points restored increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd. 
 
9th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer, Wizard A flood of repairing transmutation magic flows from you to into damaged objects and artificial creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of warforged, constructs, and objects that you can see within range. Warforged and constructs repaired by this spell are also cursed of any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on any other type of creature. 
1st-level divination Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: S, M (a set of Artisan's tools you are proficient with) Duration: 10 hours Classes: Artificer, Wizard When you cast this spell, you impart upon your chosen set of tools an intuitive insight in how best to be utilized by your hands. While you spend a workday of downtime crafting an item associated with your chosen tool, you contribute 10 gp toward completing it instead of 5 gp—essentially doubling your progress. If multiple people are contributing to the crafting of a single item, you contribute the same amount of progress as two people working toward completion. The amount of raw materials needed to complete the item (half market value) does not change. At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a slot of 5th level higher and spend the workday toward the creation of a schema or crafting of a magic item using the enhanced tool, the time spend working counts as two workdays toward completion of the schema or item. See page 47 of the Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron for more on the creation of schemas and crafting of magic items and page 123 of Xanathar’s Guide to Everything for more on downtime activities in general. 
2nd-level transmutation Casting Time: 10 minutes Range: 30 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer (Automation and Renegade only) 

 
  
 
 
 
Up to six warforged or constructs of your choice you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 4d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on any other type of creature. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of hit points repaired increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd. 
3rd-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer (Automation only) You touch a warforged or construct that has died or been destroyed within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can’t return to life a creature whose body is lacking parts or components integral for its survival—a warforged’s head, for instance—nor can it restore non-integral body parts such as a missing limb. This spell has no effect on any other type of creature. 
5th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 hour Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (diamonds worth 500 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer (Automation only) You return a dead warforged you touch to life, or a destroyed construct you touch to a functioning state, provided the creature was dead or destroyed for no longer than 10 days. A warforged’s soul must be willing and at liberty to rejoin its body. If the body and soul (if any) are in a condition for the spell to function on them, they return to life or a functioning state with 1 hit point. This spell has no effect on any other type of creature. This spell repairs all vital damage, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking parts or components integral for its survival—a warforged’s head, for instance—the spell automatically fails. Full repair can take time, and it is an ordeal for a warforged’s soul to return to life. The target takes a –4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. For every 24 hours that elapses after the spell is cast, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. 
Since there are many more races available to play in Eberron than those described in just the , below is an alternate table for the reincarnate spell that you may use in Eberron campaigns. 
 
d100 Race (and subrace) 01–04 Bugbear 05–10 Changeling 11–14 Dragonborn 15–20 Dwarf * 21–26 Elf (Khorvaire elf) * 27–30 Gnoll 31–36 Gnome (Zil gnome) * 37–42 Goblin (City goblin) 43–46 Goliath 47–52 Half-elf (First Generation) * 53–58 Half-Orc* 59–64 Halfling (Roll a d4: 1–2 Lightfoot, 3–4 Stout) * 65–70 Hobgoblin (Ghaal’dar) 71–88 Human (Paragon) * 89–90 Killoren 91–94 Minotaur 95–00 Shifter (Roll a d10: 1 Beasthide, 2 Cliffwalk, 3 Dreamsight, 4 Longtooth, 5 Razorclaw, 6 Swiftstride, 7 Swiftwing, 8 Truedive, 9 Wildhunt, 10 Winterhide) * At the DM’s option, if you reincarnate as this race, you may develop a dragonmark instead of reincarnating as the listed subrace.  

 
 
 
  
1st-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer, Wizard A warforged, construct, or object you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 2d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on any other type of creature. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a slot of 2nd level or higher, the hit points restored increase by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st. 
4th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Druid You corrode one nonmagical ferrous metal object you touch. If the object isn't being worn or carried, your touch destroys a 3-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, make a melee spell attack against the creature. If the object you are trying to touch is the creature's armor or shield, you have advantage on the attack roll. On a hit, you affect the metal object as follows: If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, its takes a permanent and cumulative -1d4 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a weapon, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1d4 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. If the object touched is a piece of ammunition, it is destroyed. 
1st-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 minute or 1 action (see text) Range: Touch Components: S Duration: 8 hours or until discharged Classes: Artificer As part of casting this spell, you cobble together a device from your supply of small parts and components you usually reserve for the creation of custom spellcasting foci. You place a spell effect into this device, drawing it forth at a later time as an action. 
The device becomes a spell-storing item for the duration of this spell; in effect a consumable magic item with a single charge which only you can activate. Choose a first level spell from any class spell list. The spell-storing item must incorporate raw materials (usually Eberron dragonshards) worth the same amount of gold as the chosen spell's expensive material components (if any) at the time you imbue the spell into the item. The spell's attack bonus and/or save DC is determined by your spellcasting ability at the time you imbue the spell into the spell-storing item. If you do not activate the spell-storing item before this spell's duration expires, then the stored spell is lost and the custom spellcasting focus becomes useless. Creating a spell-storing item is a difficult and dangerous process. When this spell's casting time is complete, you make an Arcana check; the difficulty is 13 + twice the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell. If you fail, your casting time and costly raw materials are wasted but you do not expend the spellslot used to cast this spell. However, on a failure you suffer a mishap; this is usually an unintended effect determined by the DM, or it might merely inflict 2d6 damage on you. This damage cannot be reduced by any means. You may reduce this spell's casting time to a single action, by either expending a Hit Die or spending Inspiration if you have it when you cast this spell. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd or higher, you may store any spell of a level up to the same level of spell slot used, and the spell functions as if it was being cast from the same level spell slot (for example, a 5th level spell slot can be used to create a spell-storing item that launches a fireball that deals 10d6 fire damage). Higher spell levels are even more dangerous to work with; if you take damage due to suffering a mishap, you take 2d6 damage per spell level of the spell slot you were attempting to cast from (for example, a failed attempt at using a 3rd level spell slot to imbue a spell-storing item with a fly effect might deal you 6d6 damage, if the DM doesn't decide on some other consequence). Additionally, it requires greater effort and concentration to speed up the casting time of this spell when casting it at higher levels. If you choose to expend Hit Dice to reduce this spell's casting time, you must expend Hit Dice equal to the spell's level. 

 
  
 
 
 
3rd-level transmutation Casting Time: 8 hours Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (chemicals, unguents, solvents, and at least one ounce of the metal desired, all worth at least 500 gp in total, which the spell consumes, and a set of alchemist's supplies you are proficient with worth 50 gp) Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer, Wizard, Swordmage You work laboriously for hours, submerging one melee weapon or 10 pieces of ammunition in a solution that transforms the metal comprising the weapon or ammunition into the desired metal used in the spell's material components. If the metal used in the spell's material components has special properties, such as adamantine or silver, the weapon or ammunition gains all the properties of a weapon or ammunition made from that material. Otherwise, the weapon or ammunition retains all the properties of steel but gains the appearance of the metal used in the spell's material 
6th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Artificer, Wizard You reach out and mentally analyze the magical animating force of a warforged or construct you can see within range and with an effort of will, then catastrophically disrupt it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 11d8 force damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the force damage it took. Any effect that removes a curse allows the warforged or construct’s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes. This spell has no effect on any other type of creature. 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
If your game makes use of the optional feat rule in chapter 6, “Customizing Options” of the , the following additional feats may be available for your Eberron campaign. 
 
Prerequisite: Warforged Your adamantine plates thicken and cover even more of your body, overlapping in interlocking sections to cover all your structural weak points. Though this gives you increased protection, the plating becomes impossible to remove. You gain the following traits: 
 
• Your model type becomes Adamantine Construction if it was not already, and you then lose the Remodeling racial trait, making your model type permanent. • You increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20. • Any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. • You reduce all damage you take from attacks by 1. 
 
You have studied extensively with the spiked chain and are able to fight with it and display more skill and finesse than most would believe. You gain the following benefits: 
 
• You do not have disadvantage when you use a spiked chain to attack a target within 5 feet of you. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• When you take the Attack action and attack with a only a spiked chain, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with it against an opponent within 5 feet of you. This attack deals normal damage, including your ability modifier. • When you draw a spiked chain, you can do so in such a way that the weapon's reach property is negated, wrapping the chain around your arms and shoulders so you can only strike targets up to 5 feet away from you. If you do, you gain a +1 bonus to AC while wielding a spiked chain in this way. Switching a spiked chain to or from this position while it is already drawn requires a bonus action. 
 
Prerequisite: Warforged You have honed your stone, metal, and wood construction into efficient harmony, improving your overall resilience. You gain the following benefits while your model type is Composite Plating: 
 
• You gain a +1 bonus to AC. • Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your level. • Whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you may reroll any results of 1, taking the new roll. • You automatically stabilize when brought to 0 hit points. You do not need to make death saving throws on your turn when at 0 hit points, but you may still be killed if damage forces you to automatically fail three death saving throws. 

 
  
 
 
 
Prerequisite: Must be able to use an arcane spellcasting focus and cast 2nd level spells You gain the ability to invest a construct with a portion of your soul, binding it to you as a homunculus. You must spend 4 workweeks of downtime and 500 gold to construct one. Choose a construct creature no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (see the Homunculus section of The Korranberg Chronicle: Threat Dispatch starting on page 45 for constructs particularly suitable for this purpose). After it is complete, you imbue it with a portion of your soul. Your homunculus shares your alignment. It accompanies you on your adventures and faithfully fights alongside you. Add your proficiency bonus to the homunculus's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. The creature has a total number of hit dice equal to your level minus 3, or it's normal total, whichever is higher. For every hit die it has, its hit point maximum increases accordingly. Each level you gain after taking this feat, your homunculi gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. For every 4 hit die the homunculus has, its ability scores improve. Your homunculus can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your homunculus can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise. Your homunculus can't gain feats unless otherwise noted. Your homunculus obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated, your companion acts on its own. Your homunculus remains active as long as it is within 100 feet of you. It becomes unconscious and inert if you ever move further away. If your homunculus is destroyed, a piece of your soul is lost and you suffer a –4 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time you complete a long rest, this penalty lessens by 1. Once you no longer have this penalty, you can craft a new homunculus by spending another 4 workweeks of downtime and 500 gold. You cannot have more than one homunculus active at a time. Should you begin crafting a new homunculus, the old one collapses into wasted raw materials after you finish one day of progress toward crafting the new one (and you suffer the penalty above, since the old homunculus is destroyed). 
Replaces Flail Mastery Unearthed Arcana: Feats, pg. 3 The ancient goblins of the Dhakaani Empire invented all manner of chain weapons, including the flail, dire flail, and mighty flail. You have spent countless hours studying their techniques with these weapons. You gain the following benefits when wielding any type of flail: 
 
• You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls you make with the weapon. • As a bonus action on your turn, you can prepare yourself to extend your weapon to sweep over targets' shields. Until the end of this turn, your attack rolls with the weapon gain a +2 bonus against any target using a shield. • When you hit with an opportunity attack using the weapon, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. 
 
Prerequisite: Changeling Whatever the truth of the connection between your race and the monstrous doppelgangers, you have honed a similar talent as them for invading the minds of others. You gain the following benefits: 
 
• Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20. • You learn the detect thoughts spell and can innately cast it once without expending a spell slot. When cast as an innate spell, it requires no components for you to cast. You regain the ability to innately cast detect thoughts when you finish a short or long rest. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Charisma. 

 
 
 
  
Prerequisite: Must possess a non-aberrant dragonmark Though your dragonmark does not increase in size, you have unlocked deeper power inherent in it. You learn the spells associated with your dragonmark, depending on its nature (base or Greater). If you take the Greater Dragonmark feat after this one, you gain the spell granted by this feat associated with Greater marks. All spells you learn from this feat can be cast from your dragonmark as innate spells without expending a spell slot and requiring no components unless they have a listed cost. You can cast these spells once each, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. See the Dragonmark Adept Spells table for which spells you learn for each category of true dragonmark, as well as the spellcasting ability modifier for them when you cast the from your dragonmark. Some spells function a bit differently when cast from a dragonmark, as noted below: 
 
• When you cast commune with nature from your Mark of Finding using this feat, you may only gain knowledge of three facts about the following: terrain and bodies of water; prevalent plants or minerals (including dragonshards); or the presence and nature of manifest zones. • To cast suggestion using this feat and the Mark of Scribing, you must have Calligrapher's supplies, ink and quill, or some other writing implement. As part of the action to cast the spell, you write the suggestion down (any available surface will do, such as a page in a chapbook, your palm, or even the 
floor). The written suggestion retains its enchantment as long as you concentrate on the spell, until the first creature who can understand it reads it. Thereafter the reader becomes the target of the spell as normal, and your concentration maintains the enchantment on it. The maximum amount of time you can concentrate on the entire spell does not change. • When you cast spirit guardians from your Mark of Sentinel using this feat, the spirits appear as ephemeral duplicates of yourself, made out of shimmering ribbons akin to a three-dimensional, living dragonmark. The damage the spell deals is force damage, regardless of your alignment. 
 
Prerequisite: Kalashtar, have taken no other atavist feat. Du'ulora are the dispassionate generals of nightmare armies and know the value of the application of force. Even your spirit, capable of feeling compassion and restraint, favors a direct response to legitimate threats.

You can nearly hear one of these spirits whispering to you, increasing your psionic might. You gain the following benefits: 
 
• Increase your Strength or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20. • Incite Fury. Your du'ulora instinctively understands anger and rage and allows you to ignite the wild emotion in your foes. You may cast the compelled

Once you cast the spell using this feat, you must finish a long rest before you may do so again. • Far Hand. You know the mage hand cantrip. When you cast mage hand, the hand you create is invisible. Strength or Intelligence (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip. 
 
You master the art of using two wands to perform somatic components for two spells simultaneously, gaining the following benefits: 
 
• Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20. • As an action, you can expend a spell slot of at least 2nd-level to simultaneously cast two cantrips when wielding a wand in each hand. You supply the somatic component for each cantrip with each wand. • You can draw or stow two wands when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one. • Every two magic wands that you are attuned to count as only one magic item for the purposes of your magic item attunement limit. • When you expend charges to activate a magic item you are attuned to, you may reduce the cost of expended charges by 1, to a minimum of 0.

Prerequisite: Shifter, character level 8th You strengthen your racial shifting ability after much experience, granting you several benefits: 
 
• You may shift one additional time before resting. You regain all expended uses of your shifting trait when you finish a short or long rest. • As long as you are not surprised, you may shift as a reaction when you roll initiative. • While shifting, you ignore up to 2 levels of exhaustion. If you have more than 2 levels of exhaustion, your exhaustion level is treated as 2 lower for the duration of your shift. • If you are reduced to 0 hit points while shifting, you may stay conscious and continue fighting until you fail two death saving throws. (You make death saving throws at the end of your turn when at 0 hit 
points as normal, and every time you take damage while at 0 hit points it is considered an automatic failed death saving throw.) • When your shift ends, if you are at 0 hit points, you fall unconscious (if you are not already) and become stable. • When your shift ends, if you have 1 or more hit points, you heal a number of hit points equal to the amount of temporary hit points you gained at the start of your shift. 
 
Prerequisite: Shifter You are a rare shifter that manifests two shifting aspects. Choose a second shifter subrace (you can't choose your existing subrace twice). You gain the following benefits: 
 
• One ability score of your choice that is normally increased by the chosen shifter subrace increases by 1, to a maximum of 20. • You gain the Shifting Feature of the chosen subrace. When you shift, you gain the benefits of both subrace’s Shifting Features simultaneously. • You gain proficiency with any skill the chosen subrace grants proficiency with. 
 
You are extremely talented at setting out into the unknown—and more importantly, coming back alive. Your reflexes are honed to avoid unexpected danger, and you are light on your feet when unencumbered by bulky armor, and you also have a knack for surviving certain doom with sheer luck. 
 
• While you are wearing light armor or are unarmored, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. • You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps, and you gain an additional +1 bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. • Your walking speed increases by 5 feet when you are wearing light armor or are unarmored. • You gain 1 luck point.

You can choose to spend your luck point after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You can also spend a luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20, and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker’s roll or yours. 

 
 
 
  
If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled. You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest. If you have another source of luck points, such as the Lucky feat, your total number of luck points is equal to as many as each source provides added together, and you regain them all when you finish a long rest. 
 
Prerequisite: Kalashtar, have taken no other atavist feat. Hashalaq quori loyal to the Darkness that Dreams wield empathy and desire like a poisoned dagger. Morally repulsed by this behavior, your spirit was instrumental in finding other quori dissatisfied with the Dreaming Dark and masking the flight of the kalashtar spirits from Dal Quor.

The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The DC to resist this is equal to 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice). You may use this ability at will. 
 
Prerequisite: Shifter Your shifter aspect has grown more pronounced than others of your kind, granting you increased benefits when you shift. You gain the benefits below associated with your shifter subrace. If you have the Extra Shifter Aspect feat, you gain the benefits associated with only one of your subraces. However, when eligible you may take this feat a second 
time to gain the below benefits associated with your other shifter subraces:

At the end of your turn you fall the remaining 30 feet. If you are still in midair at the end of this freefall and have not collided with a surface, you are no longer falling and may resume flying on your next turn. Otherwise you take falling damage as normal.

• Your Constitution score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20 • While shifting, you are immune to cold damage and you gain a +1 bonus to AC. If you shift as a reaction to taking cold damage and this bonus would increase your AC above the result of the attack roll, the attack misses you.

You have advantage on Charisma checks when interacting with members of the press, nobility, and Dragonmarked Houses. Once per month, you may give a lecture at a notable institution, such as Morgrave University or the Library of Korranberg, and earn gold pieces equal to 10 times the result of a Charisma (Performance) check. • Rescue Artist. You are skilled at saving others from harrowing situations. If a creature begins to fall within your line of sight, you may use your reaction to move up to your speed and automatically catch them. Additionally, when you take the Help action to aid another creature in escaping from a grapple, they automatically succeed on their escape attempt. Finally, you may carry a Medium or smaller creature in addition to your normal carrying capacity without becoming encumbered for up to 1 minute. After a minute of doing so, you must finish a short or long rest before you can carry a creature this way again. 
• Aereni Crystallomancy. You may cast the false life spell. When you do, it requires an additional material component of an Irian-infused Eberron dragonshard found only on the Isle of Aerenal worth at least 200 gp, and it is cast as though from a 3rd level spell slot. Intelligence is your spellcasting 
ability for this spell. Once you cast this spell, you must finish a long rest to do so again. • Friend of the Aereni. Your presence is always welcome in the Aereni port of Pylas Talaear. You always have free accommodations in the city, and the governor, Syraen Melidith, will subsidize half the cost of any House Lyrandar airship or galleon trip you make to or from Pylas Talaear. Additionally, you may purchase mundane goods at half-cost while in the city. • Honorary Tairnadal. The Valenar elves welcome you as one of their own, and one of their majestic mounts has even formed an unbreakable bond with you. You learn the find steed spell, but you may only summon a Valenar Riding Horse with it (even if you are not a Valenar elf). Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Once you cast this spell, you must finish a long rest to do so again. (See page 14 of The Korranberg Chronicle: Threat Dispatch for the Valenar Riding Horse’s statistics.) 
• Dragonsong. Once, distantly, you heard the rocky barrier coast of Argonnessen come alive with the song of dragons. You may call on the memory of the tragic glory of dragonsong as a Reaction to gain advantage on all saving throws against becoming charmed for as long as you concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell) for up to 1 minute. Once you call upon this memory, you may not do so again until you finish a short or long rest. • Seren Hide. Conditioning yourself with techniques learned alongside Seren barbarians, you have inured yourself to physical harm. Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage you take from non-magical weapons is reduced by 1, and when not wearing armor you have an AC of 12 + your Dexterity modifier. • Vicious Barbarism. You've learned to fight like the vicious barbarians of the Seren Isles. As a bonus action, you may enter a reckless frenzy for 1 minute. During this frenzy, you deal 2 additional damage with all melee weapon attacks, but all attack rolls against you are made with advantage. You may end your reckless frenzy early by taking another bonus action to do so. It also ends early if you are knocked unconscious. When your reckless frenzy ends, you may not enter another reckless frenzy until you finish a long rest. 

 
  
 
 
 
• Blessed of Shargon. You have earned the blessing of Shargon, preventing the need for you and any crew or passengers of the ship you are traveling on from making sacrifices or offerings to the sahuagin of the Thunder Sea. Because of this boon, any captain will welcome you and your party aboard their vessels at no cost, including Lyrandar wind galleons. Furthermore, the sahuagin escort you and your vessel on journeys across Shargon's Teeth, eliminating the possibility of being attacked by creatures of challenge rating 9 or less. • Breath of Shargon. You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution score. • Malenti Pearl Trick. You may cast the charm person spell. When you do, it requires an additional material component of a pearl worth at least 100 gp. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Once you cast this spell, you must finish a long rest to do so again. 
• Ally of Rushemé. You have communed with the Guardians of Rushemé and have been granted the mystical ability to call on the strength of giantkind. You gain the ability to cast enlarge/reduce, but only on yourself and only using the enlarge option. Strength is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Once you cast this spell, you may not do so again until you finish a long rest. • Ghost of Xen'drik. In any jungle environment, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Survival) checks. Additionally, you are considered a native to Xen'drik for the purposes of navigation and the Traveler's Curse. • Pandin Temn. You have trained at the side of Vulkoori drow to be a scourge of giants. Against the attacks of giants, you have a +1 bonus to AC if you are wearing no or light armor, and all of your attacks deal 2 additional damage against giants. • Xen'drik Boomerang Expert. You are proficient with Xen'drik boomerangs and you double their short and long ranges when throwing them. Additionally, Xen'drik boomerangs always return to you at the end of your turn when you throw them, whether they hit or miss, and you automatically succeed on catching them. 
 
 

 
 
 
  
Prerequisite: Kalashtar, have taken no other atavist feat. Tsoreva are the weakest and most vicious of quori, but the tsoreva of your lineage never had the desire to slaughter foes mindlessly. Rather, it vowed to wield its mind blades in the defense of the innocent. Representative lineages include Atah, Mira, and Zari. You can nearly hear one of these spirits whispering to you, increasing your psychic might. You gain the following benefits: 
 
• Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20. • Terror Strike. Your tsoreva wielded fear as literal weapons, and your strengthened bond with it allows you to do the same. You may cast the wrathful smite spell, using no components. Dexterity or Intelligence (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Once you cast the spell using this feat, you must finish a long rest before you may do so again. • Mind Blade. As an action, you can momentarily manifest a magical blade of pure psionic energy and make a melee weapon attack with it. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. The weapon deals 1d8 psychic damage on hit and has the finesse property. After you make the attack, the blade disappears. This ability's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). 
 
Prerequisite: Kalashtar, have taken no other atavist feat. Tsucora are creatures of nightmare and fear. Although your spirit turned away from darkness and evil, it cannot help but to have an instinctive ability to inflict terror. Representative lineages include Azerai, Melk, and Tari. You can nearly hear one of these spirits whispering to you, increasing your telepathic abilities. You gain the following benefits:

Prerequisite: Kalashtar, have taken no other atavist feat. Usvapna quori, otherwise known as the "dream masters" are creatures that manipulate and corrupt minds, convincing dreaming mortals of their own lack of worth. Your usvapna quori found these practices revolting and vowed only to bring crushing despair on those responsible for tyranny. Representative lineages include Belv, Kustai, and Talem. You can nearly hear one of these spirits whispering to you, increasing your telepathic abilities. You gain the following benefits: 
 
• Increase your Charisma or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20. • Inflict Despair. Your usvapna has given you the ability to cause such utter self-loathing in a foe that they become incapacitated. You may cast the Tasha’s hideous laughter spell, using no components. The spell functions as normal, except the target does not laugh and perceive everything as funny, but rather perceives everything as meaningless, most of all themselves, and weeps uncontrollably for the duration of the spell. Charisma or Intelligence (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Once you cast the spell using this feat, you must finish a long rest before you may do so again. • Mind Crush. As an action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage. If it takes any of this damage and is Large or smaller, it is knocked prone. This ability's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). 
 
Replaces Revenant Blade Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron, pg. 74 The Valenar elves have spent millennia perfecting their technique with scimitars and double scimitars, in emulation of their heroic ancestors. You have spent countless hours studying with these weapons. You gain the following benefits: 
 
• Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20. • You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with scimitars and double scimitars. • When you use a scimitar or double scimitar, its damage die changes from a d6 to 2d4. • If you do not already add your ability modifier to the damage of the attack you make as a bonus action when engaging in two-weapon fighting, you may now do so when wielding a double scimitar or engaging in two-weapon fighting with a scimitar.

layer characters have access to extra gear and equipment in the world of Eberron. This chapter will detail such items—both mundane and magical. 
Eberron sports a variety of new weapons created by the various peoples and cultures found upon it—such as the Dhakaani goblins, Talenta halflings, the drow of Xen’drik, and more. The Weapons table details these weapons in the same manner as the weapons in chapter 5 of the . In addition to the weapon properties described in that book, there is one new property some of the new weapons detailed below share: 
 
A double weapon has two striking ends on either side of an elongated grip. It is too unwieldy for Small creatures to handle properly; they have disadvantage on attacks rolls with double-ended weapons. When you use your Attack action to make an attack with a double-ended weapon, you can also use a bonus action to make an additional attack with it. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus action attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style or Dual Wielder feat, you gain all of their benefits while wielding a double-ended weapon, as if it were two different weapons. 
 
 
The Korranberg Chronicle: Adventurer’s Almanac has a different take on the double-ended scimitar detailed on page 74 of the Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron. This tome introduces a new weapon property and several other kinds of double-ended weapons besides the Valenar elves’ signature weapon, and it allows anyone to use both ends of the weapon without requiring a feat. In terms of raw power, weapons with the double property are balanced and equivalent to normal twoweapon fighting. 
 
 
 
 
 
Weapons with special rules are described here. Bola. A Large or smaller creature hit by a bola is knocked prone and has its speed reduced to 0 until it is freed. A bola has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to free itself. The DC for this check is equal to 8 + the proficiency modifier of the bola's thrower + the thrower's Strength or Dexterity modifier (thrower's choice). Another creature can attempt a Strength (Athletics) check against the same DC to free a target hit with a bola within 5 feet of it. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the bola's cords (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it. If a creature is freed by a Strength (Athletics) check or by dealing slashing damage to the bola, the bola is destroyed. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a bola, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. Boomerang. Three main types of boomerangs exist in Eberron: the Adar boomerang (also called a chakram), which does slashing damage, the Talenta boomerang, which does bludgeoning damage, and Xen'drik boomerang, which does piercing damage. When you miss a ranged attack roll with a nonmagical boomerang, it returns to you at the end of your turn. A non-magical boomerang can be caught with a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Magical boomerangs return to you at the end of your turn, regardless of whether you hit or miss, and they can be caught automatically. If you fail the Acrobatics check or you do not have a hand free to catch the returning boomerang, it falls to the ground 10 feet away from you in a random direction. Orc Double Axe. The orc double axe was created by the Ghaash’kala orcs of the Demon Wastes to allow their warriors to more effectively impede trespassers in the Labyrinth. It is such a rarity to see them in the markets of Khorvaire that even a mundane double axe made from steel will fetch a higher price than some magic items. An orc double axe may be wielded as either a double-ended weapon that deals d6 slashing damage, or a heavy weapon that deals d8 slashing 

 
 
 
  
damage. A wielder may switch from one way to the other as an object interaction on their turn, before any attack rolls are made. Spiked Chain. You have disadvantage when you use a spiked chain to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Spiked chains are notoriously difficult to control, so even proficient wielders must exercise extreme caution when employing spiked chains in close quarters. 
Sword Cane. This weapon is actually a hollow sheath for a rapier or specially made shortsword. The rapier or special shortsword is not included in the price of the sword cane; rapiers have their listed cost in the PHB and a specially fitted shortsword costs 20 gp instead of 10 gp but otherwise uses the normal statistics for a shortsword. Each sword cane can only accommodate the weapon it was created for. While sheathed in a sword cane, the weapon is completely hidden and only a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check made while holding and inspecting the cane reveals its nature as a sheath. The cane is made of strong hardwood and can be used as a weapon itself, using the listed statistics.

Beyond silver and adamantine, weapons in Eberron are often made from a plethora of special ores or other materials. The Weapon Materials table summarizes how much more expensive a weapon made out of each material is, as well as how the material modifies the weight of the weapon. Below are the rules for type of material. 
Adamantine is an ultra-hard metal found in meteorites and extraordinary mineral veins. In addition to being used to craft adamantine armor, the metal is also used for weapons. Some creatures, such as certain types of constructs, are resistant or immune to weapons not made from adamantine. Additionally, melee weapons and ammunition made of adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an adamantine weapon or piece of ammunition hits an object, the hit is a critical hit. The adamantine version of a melee weapon or of ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal versions. 
This lustrous, purple metal is incredibly dense and heavy. It is mined from mountain ranges in western Khorvaire, typically the Byeshk and Graywall Mountains. It is typically worn as jewelry and is considered a precious metal akin to silver, gold, or platinum. Certain aberrant creatures have a distinct aversion to the metal and are resistant or immune to weapons that aren't byeshk. Druidic sects of the Eldeen Reaches, most often the Wardens of the Wood or Gatekeepers, trade with the mountainous peoples for byeshk ore to make use of this susceptibility. Byeshk is far too heavy to forge weapons entirely from it, so the druids use a process of electroplating to apply a thin layer of byeshk to steel weapons. Even still, weapons that normally have the light or finesse property lose those properties when plated in byeshk. The byeshk version of a melee weapon or ten pieces of ammunition costs 200 gp more than the normal versions.
 
Material Cost Weight Modifier Adamantine +500 gp x 1.5 Bronzewood +200 gp x 0.9 Byeshk +200 gp x 2 Flametouched Iron +400 gp x 1 Mithral +500 gp x 0.5 Orichalcum +400 gp x 0.5 Silver +100 gp x 1 Targath +300 gp x 1 
Bronzewood is an especially dense and sturdy wood found only on the Isle of Aerenal. It is used in place of metal in many applications, including the crafting of weapons. Bronzewood weapons cannot be corroded by rust and acid (making them immune to deleterious effects caused by rust monsters and black puddings, for example), but have no other unique properties besides their reduced weight. The bronzewood version of a melee weapon or ten pieces of ammunition costs 200 gp more than normal versions, due mainly to the rarity of bronzewood trees. 
Flametouched iron is only found in Thrane and is considered sacred by the Church of the Silver Flame. When freshly mined, the raw iron ore appears to be corroded with rust, but when refined it glimmers with a bluish, silvery sheen. Fiends and undead abhor the touch of flametouched iron. Attacks made with weapons and ammunition forged of flametouched iron ignore any resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage a fiend or non-deathless undead creature has and deal half damage to such creatures who have immunity to bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage. The flametouched iron version of a melee weapon or ten pieces of ammunition costs 400 gp more than the normal versions. 
Mithral is a gleaming, rare form of silver, lighter and stronger than steel. In addition to being used to craft mithral armor, it can also be used to create light, elegant weapons. Weapons with the thrown property and ammunition have their short and long ranges doubled when made from mithral. Melee weapons that do not normally have the heavy property gain the finesse property when made from mithral. Melee weapons that do normally have the heavy property do not have 

 
 
 
  
it when made from mithral. Finally, mithral weapons count as silver for the purposes of some creatures' resistances or immunities to weapons not made from silver. The mithral version of a melee weapon or ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal versions. 
Orichalcum is a material used by the Sulatar drow for their weapons and armor. It has the appearance of polished, golden bronze. It has all the same properties of mithral, except it does not count as silver for the purposes of creatures' resistance or immunity to weapons not made from silver. Due to the rarity of orichalcum falling out of the hands of Sulatar drow, a melee weapon or ten pieces of ammunition made from it costs 400 gp more than the normal versions. 
Silver is a precious metal usually too soft to be used in the forging of weapons. However, some monsters that have immunity or resistance to non-magical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. A silvered weapon or ten pieces of ammunition cost 100 gp more than the normal versions. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective. 
Targath is a soft metal ore mined on the northern coast of Argonnessen and the Seren Isles. It is jealously guarded by the Seren barbarian tribes, because it has supernatural health-promoting properties. Carrying a significant amount of targath on your person, such a weapon or at least ten pieces of ammunition coated in it, grants you advantage on saving throws to resist disease. Mysteriously, targath is also anathema to the deathless elves of the Undying Court, and they are susceptible to weapons coated in it. A weapon or ten pieces of ammunition coated in targath costs 300 gp more than the normal versions. This cost represents not only the price of the targath, but the time and expertise needed to add it to the weapon without making it less effective. 
 
Several new tool kits and proficiencies are available to player characters in the world of Eberron. Below are three new tool kits that characters can gain proficiency with. Each are given a detailed description as per chapter 2, “Dungeon Master’s Tools” of Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, and their prices and weights are given in the Tools table. 
 
  Tool kit Cost Weight Artisan’s tools  Artificer’s tools 50 gp 3 lb. Glyphbook set 20 gp 2 lb. Investigator’s kit 30 gp 5 lb. 
 
Artificer’s tools are one kind of artisan’s tools designed to enable you to repair and craft complex mechanical objects. Components. Artificer's tools include a small saw, hammer, files, pliers, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and tweezers, and a small crucible and molds for casting gears and other clockwork components. They also include an array of crystal and specialized equipment for channeling magical forces. Arcana. Proficiency with artificer's tools provides you with more information on Arcana checks involving constructs and magic items with complex mechanisms. History. Your knowledge of mechanical engineering grants you additional insight when answering questions about the origins of such devices. Investigation, Perception. This tool proficiency can aid in identifying a mechanical trap and determining how it functions. Craft Clockwork Item. With two days of downtime, a set of artificer's tools, and 10 gp worth of materials, you can work for 8 hours each day to craft a complex clockwork mechanism or device. Some examples of what you can make are: an alarm, a calculator, a clockwork toy, an igniter, a pocket watch, or a music box (though you must also be proficient with Perform checks or a musical instrument to craft this item).

Designed by Nausicaä Harris Originally the Translator’s kit , pg. 25 Despite the name, glyphbooks offer no help in dealing with magical glyphs of warding. Rather, they are guides to deciphering ancient languages or coded messages; translation of ancient languages is a popular pastime among Khorvaire’s educated elite and growing educated middle class, and codebreakers abounded during the Last War. Failures with a glyphbook may not always imply that you cannot decrypt or translate the text; sometimes you glean inaccurate messages, at the DM’s discretion. Alternate Proficiency. If your background or class would grant you proficiency in a Musical Instrument or a kind of Gaming Set, you may instead gain proficiency with all kinds of Glyphbook Sets instead. Likewise, if your class of background grants you a Musical Instrument or a Gaming Set as starting equipment, you may start with one kind of Glyphbook set instead. Components. A glyphbook set contains one of the following: a volume of cryptographic cyphers, a textbook on Primordial languages, a compilation of Sarlonan languages, or a guide to languages of Xen’drik. All also contain a collection of scratch paper and charcoal for taking rubbings or working out cryptological problems. Proficiency with Glyphbook sets applies to all types of glyphbooks, but each type of set (each language text or the cryptography cyphers) must be purchased individually. Arcana. A glyphbook can be used in conjunction with the Arcana skill to help you determine whether a magical text hails from a certain tradition or location associated with the language family or families it details. Deception. A glyphbook can assist you in the creation of ciphers, codes, and other secret messages. History. Glyphbook proficiency assists you in deciphering ancient writings, frescoes, carvings, and other forms of visual communication associated with the ancient cultures who spoke the language family or families it treats with. Recorded Messages. With the cryptographic glyphbook, you can accurately record coded messages you intercept; with any of the others, you can take accurate rubbings of important inscriptions while traveling. 
Activity DC Decipher a simple cipher 10 Decrypt a competent code 15 Decrypt a complex code 20 Translate a simple message in a foreign language 20 Decrypt a military code 25 Translate a long passage in a foreign language 25 Decrypt a magic code 10 + caster's spell save DC Translate a passage in a dead language 30 
A crime scene is a delicate environment to investigate; the most minor misstep can obfuscate an important clue. Serious inquisitives make use of this kit to ensure the most success in recovering evidence from sensitive surroundings. Alternate Proficiency. If your background or class would grant you proficiency in Thieves' tools, you may instead gain proficiency with Inquisitive's kits instead. Likewise, if your class of background grants you a set of Thieves' tools as starting equipment, you may start with an Inquisitive's kit instead. Components. An Inquisitive's kit contains a pair of fine silk gloves, a magnifying glass, dusting powder and brush, chalk and charcoal, cotton swabs, tweezers, and an assortment or glass, metal, and wooden containers for storing samples. It also includes a small journal and quill for recording notes. History. Your familiarity with crime scene investigations aids you in remembering past cases where important evidence was found by a skilled inquisitive at a crime scene. Perception. Your training makes it easier for you to identify an area as the scene of a crime or altercation, prompting further investigation. Investigation. An Inquisitive's kit is considered essential equipment for finding clues in area that is the scene of a crime. Medicine, Nature. An Inquisitive’s kit is also useful for collecting specimens and can assist you in identifying rare or unusual substances (such as poisons), organisms, or diseases. Sealed Sampling. You can preserve small amounts of a substance in containers treated—through alchemical and mundane means—to keep them from suffering the passage of time. While this cannot preserve anything larger than an ounce or longer an inch, you can still scrape or clip off a trace amount 

 
 
 
  
large enough to be identified by a more trained researcher. Profile Suspect. After finding clues with the Investigate skill, with 1 hour of work you can analyze found evidence with an Inquisitive's kit to intuit an aspect of the identity of the creature the evidence points to, by making a check and referring to the below DCs. 
 
 
Activity DC Determine race and gender of suspect 15 Determine age of suspect 20 Determine social status of suspect 20 
In addition to the mundane items useful for all types of adventurers found in the , below are several new items for player characters in an Eberron game, including alchemical items and clockwork devices. The Adventuring Gear table also includes new prices for gear replacing the prices listed on the table on page 150 of the . These adjusted prices are to reflect the more advanced industries and means of production that the citizens of the Five Nations enjoy.

If it is not located and disabled using a predesignated sequence of switches (requiring an Action) before the 6 seconds expire, it begins making a shrill ringing that lasts for 1 hour and can be heard from up to 300 feet away. Alchemical acid. This vial of caustic liquid and be hurled at a creature or object within 30 feet of you as an action. The vial shatters on impact. A creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage. An object automatically takes that damage, and the damage is maximized. Alchemical frost. This vial is filled with a thin liquid that grows extremely cold when exposed to air. It and be hurled at a creature or object within 30 feet of you as an action. The vial shatters on impact. A creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage. An object automatically takes that damage. Alchemical lightning. This flask has two compartments, each filled with a separate substance. When combined, the two substances react violently. As an action, you can hurl the flask at a creature or object within 30 feet of you. If the target fails a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, the flask shatters and allows the substances to mix, releasing a powerful electrical discharge, dealing 1d6 lightning damage to the target. An object automatically takes that damage. Armored hem. Perfect for those looking for an extra bit of protection, these interlocking plates of metal and chain can be sewn into the hem of any coat or cloak, even magical ones. An armored hem grants you a +1 bonus to AC when worn with no armor or light armor but it limits your maximum Dexterity bonus to AC to +3. Wearing an armored hem with medium or heavy armor grants no additional benefit. While wearing an armored hem, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you cannot cast spells unless you are proficient in light armor. Armored hem, mithral. An armored hem constructed of mithral has reduced weight and provides increased mobility. A mithral armored hem functions as regular one but allows you to apply a maximum Dexterity bonus of +4 to your Armor Class. In addition, you do not have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks from wearing a mithral armored hem, and it does not interfere with casting spells. Calculator. This device makes doing long sums easy. Clockwork toy. This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, 
or soldier. The children of nobles and prominent dragonmarked heirs often have entire themed collections of clockwork toys, while a merchant or magewright’s children might eagerly await the rare one they receive only on special occasions. When fully wound and placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground every six seconds, in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents. It operates for 1 minute, then must be rewound. Explosive oil. This is a vial of volatile liquid that explodes in a conflagration when exposed to air. As an action, you can hurl the vial at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet of you. On impact, the vial detonates in a 5-foot radius. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage. Holy symbol, flametouched. Holy symbols dedicated to the Silver Flame may be crafted from flametouched iron, a rare variety of ore that is only mined in Thrane. If you present a flametouched iron holy symbol while attempting to turn undead or fiends, the saving throw DC to resist the effect increases by 1. Igniter. The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, campfire, or other flammable object within 5 feet of you. Using the device requires an action. Library, basic. This 20-to-30 volume encyclopedia set covers a single topic represented by a type of Intelligence skill check used to recall lore (such as Arcana, History, or Nature). The DM might also allow a simple library to cover lore about another skill (for example, researching medical lore with the Medicine skill), but using a library is an Intelligence check, regardless of which skill is used. Perusal of a basic library takes 1d4-1 hours (minimum 1) and provides advantage on the skill check. Library, simple. This bookshelf is stacked with several tomes of lore from many different sources and covers a single topic represented by a type of Intelligence skill check used to recall lore (such as Arcana, History, or Nature). The DM might also allow a simple library to cover lore about another skill (for example, researching animal husbandry methods with the Animal Handling skill), but using a library is an Intelligence check, regardless of which skill is used. Perusal of a simple library takes 1d4+1 hours and provides advantage on the skill check. In addition, you may peruse a simple library to reroll failed Intelligence checks to recall lore on the topic it covers, with each attempt taking 1d4+1 hours. 
 

 
 
 
  
Library, complex. More complex libraries are exponentially larger than basic or simple libraries, and often require a staff of full-time curators to keep up to date and relevant. They cannot be purchased, but access to them can be granted by membership in specific organizations, or by request, as appropriate for each institution. They cover multiple topics represented by Intelligence skill checks used to recall lore (such as Arcana, History, or Nature). The DM might also allow a complex library to include lore about other skills (for example, finding a transcription of an ancient play with the Performance skill), but using a library is an Intelligence check, regardless of which skill is used. Perusal of a complex library takes 1d4+4 hours, grants advantage on the skill check, and allows you to reroll failed Intelligence checks on skills and topics they cover, with each attempt taking 1d4+4 hours. In addition, complex libraries also allow you to double your proficiency bonus with the relevant skill check, if you already have proficiency with it. Below are three examples of such larger institutions: The Morgrave University Library in Upper Menthis, Sharn covers all Intelligence (History) checks, and also Intelligence (Arcana and Nature) checks that relate to Xen'drik. Access to Morgrave University's library is only granted to enrolled students, and individuals under the patronage of the university's faculty. The Arcanix's Athenaeum covers all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, Intelligence (Religion) checks relating to the practices of secret cults, and Intelligence (History) checks that relate to legendary mages, historical magical events, and the magical practices of ancient kingdoms. Access to The Arcanix's Athenaeum is only granted to citizens of Aundair with spellcasting ability, but special exceptions might be made for visiting mages of sufficient skill or individuals proven to be working for the good of Aundair. The Argentum Archive is an exclusive catalogue of ancient artifacts and religious lore, focusing on items of clearly demonic origins or magic that can easily be abused for great ill. It is maintained in secret by the Church of the Silver Flame and access to it is only granted to members of the Argentum, so they can research and compile a list of target artifacts for retrieval. It covers all Intelligence (Religion) checks, and Intelligence (Arcana) and Intelligence (History) checks related to topics of fiendish magic and artifacts. The Library of Korranberg in Zilargo is the most famous library in Khorvaire. It covers all types of skill checks to recall any sort of lore. Citizens of Korranberg are required to devote four years of service to the Library but have free access to its use for life. Many 
choose to extend the term of their service as a full career, accepting posts as lecturers, researchers, administrators, and other important positions. For non-citizens, temporary access can be purchased at the rate of 100 gp per day. This includes a private study room and accommodations for the night. Magebinders. These mundane manacles include unarticulated, immobile gauntlets. When a Small or Medium creature is locked into them, that creature cannot move their fingers at all. This makes it impossible to supply the somatic components for any spell, limiting a spellcaster bound with them significantly. The bound creature cannot attempt to escape the magebinders except by brute force, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to break them. Each set of magebinders comes with one key. Without the key, a creature that is not currently bound by the magebinders and that is proficient with thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Mage binders have 20 hit points. Music box. When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed. Pocket watch. This device keeps accurate time down to the minute but must be wound every day. The listed price is for the most basic of time pieces, but more fashionable and decorated pieces can be purchased at a commensurately increased price point. Potion bracer. In the midst of battle, you may not have much time to imbibe a potion, let alone have a hand free to hold a vial. A potion bracer is a leather band reinforced with strips of steel, with slots for three potion vials. Worn on the forearm, it allows instant hands-free access to these three potions. You may drink (but not administer) a potion from a worn potion bracer as a bonus action. However, unlike a potion safely stowed in a pack, potions slotted into a bracer are very obvious to observers—and can be directly attacked. As an action, an opponent can attempt to smash a potion you have stored in a bracer by making an attack roll contested by your Dexterity save. If your opponent wins the contest, the attack deals no damage to you, but one of the potion vials stored in the bracer (chosen randomly) shatters. Potion bracer, adamantine. An adamantine potion bracer is constructed with additional reinforcement, making it harder for an enemy to shatter potions stored in it. You have advantage on your contested Dexterity saving throw to resist having one of your potions destroyed while wearing an adamantine potion bracer. 

 
  
 
 
 
Due to the increased weight and fortification, a masterwork potion bracer interferes with spellcasting. If you are not normally proficient with Dexterity saves, you cannot cast spells while wearing one. Smoke stick. A smoke stick is a small ash-wood stick that can produce a thick plume of smoke when it is struck against a hard surface as an action. You can hold on to the stick or throw it to a point up to 30 feet away as part of the action used strike it. The area in a 10-foot radius around the stick is filled with thick smoke that blocks vision, including darkvision. The smoke persists for 1 minute and then dissipates. At the end of this minute, the wooden stick has completely sublimated into smoke and is gone. Smoked lenses. Invented by enterprising fullblooded orcs of House Tharashk to aid them in Eberron dragonshard prospecting, these lenses are expertly crafted to not skew or otherwise interfere with the wearer's vision. The lenses are smoked and make vision through them dusky. You may ignore the Sunlight Sensitivity trait while wearing smoked lenses. The lenses have no effect against magically produced light. You may put on or remove smoked lenses as part of your normal movement and action on your turn without detriment, but if the lenses are somehow abruptly removed (such as by being struck with a critical hit) while you are in an area of bright light or in sunlight, you are blinded for 1 minute. You may attempt a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of your turns during this time, ending the blindness on a success. You may wear smoked lenses even if you do not have Sunlight Sensitivity, as many denizens of Khorvaire find them stylish. If you do not have Darkvision, you see everything not in direct sunlight as if it was lightly obscured by dim light, but you are not blinded if the lenses are abruptly removed. Sunrod. This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. It clearly illuminates a 30foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless. Tanglefoot bag. This bag is filled with a writhing, sticky, black tar-like substance. You can and hurl a tanglefoot bag at a point on the ground within 30 feet of you as an action. The bag bursts on impact and covers the ground in a 5-foot radius with sticky goo. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute, and any creature that starts its turn on the ground in that area has its speed halved for that turn. Thunderstone. A thunderstone is a crystalline shard about the size of a human's thumb. As an action, you can hurl it at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet of you. The shard shatters on impact with a 
blast of concussive energy. Each creature within 10 feet of the point of impact must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 10 feet away from that point. Trinket, targath. Targath is a rare metal from Argonnessen with mysterious health-promoting properties. Wearing a trinket, such as an amulet or bracelet, made from targath grants you advantage on saving throws to resist disease.

Eberron is a world were magic has become industry. As discussed in the Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron, the Dragonmarked Houses uses dragonshard focus items to maintain their economic superiority. Warforged can attach and embed themselves with special magical components to improve their functions or grant entirely new abilities. In addition to these, the prevalence of magic in the world and the military research and development of the Last War has contributed to the creation of several magic items that anyone can wield. 
Potion, rare Developed during the Last War, alchemical wrath is an elixir that causes its imbiber to enter a state of pure berserk fury. Mass production was quickly abandoned when it became readily apparent that many soldiers who partook of the experimental concoction and died in battle actually suffered no grievous injuries and in fact dropped dead after the fighting was over. Nowadays, this extremely potent draught can only be found on the black market. When you drink alchemical wrath, for 1 minute afterward you may make an extra attack when you take the Attack action on your turn. While many warriors find alchemical wrath to be exhilarating, and it is not actually addictive, it takes a serious toll on the those who drink it. Every time you imbibe a dose of alchemical wrath, at the end of its duration, your current and maximum hit points are reduced by 5 points for every dose you took since your last long rest (5 after the first dose, 10 after the second, etc.). If this reduces your current or maximum hit points to 0, you immediately die. Every time you finish a long rest, the reduction of your maximum hit points from the oldest dose is restored. 
Weapon (hand crossbow), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3), or legendary (+3) This weapon appears to be a hand crossbow, except that it lacks a crossbar and has a covered flight groove. When making an attack with a bolt launcher, you have a bonus to attack and damage rolls. The bonus is determined by the weapon's rarity. Additionally, a bolt launcher creates its own ammunition every time you attack with it, allowing you to ignore both the loading and ammunition properties of the hand crossbow. If you desire, you can load the bolt launcher with pre-existing ammunition 

 
  
 
 
 
(for instance, if you wish to fire a dragon slaying bolt from it). If you do, the bolt launcher does not create ammunition for the next attack you make with it, but fires the loaded bolt instead. When you make an attack with a legendary bolt launcher, you can choose for the created ammunition to be a normal bolt, or a bolt made from a special material, such as adamantine, byeshk, or mithral. If you do, the bolt has all the properties of that special material. Bolts fired from a bolt launcher disappear after they hit or miss their target. The magical propulsion of a bolt fired from a bolt launcher is roughly as loud as its mundane counterpart. 
Wand, common (requires attunement) A cantrip caster wand (often referred to colloquially as a "'trip-caster"), is imbued with the magic necessary to cast a single cantrip spell, chosen as the time of its creation. A character attuned to the cantrip caster knows that cantrip but may only cast it by using the cantrip as a spellcasting focus for the spell (the attuned character may use the wand as a spellcasting focus for the cantrip imbued in it, even if they normally cannot use wands a spellcasting focus). If the attuned caster is not a spellcaster in their own right, the cantrip is always cast as if by a 1st-level character. Cantrip casters are common equipment in town guard arsenal, those concerned with personal safety, and on the frontlines of the Last War. 90% of all cantrip casters were created to cast a damage-dealing cantrip, such as fire bolt or ray of frost, so a wand in a holster is treated as a deadly weapon by everyone. Cantrip casters are sold on the open market (where legal) for anywhere between 80 to 120 gp. 
Wondrous item, common Darkweave clothing is always custom made to-order. Outfits incorporating darkweave clothing typically cost 100 to 200 gp, depending on the tailor and the desired complexity of the outfit. Raw shadow is woven into the material of darkweave clothing, lending a shadowy appearance to you while you wear them. While in areas of dim light or darkness, you may roll 1d4 and add the result to Dexterity (Stealth) checks to avoid being seen. 
Wondrous item, common This exceptionally crafted quill has a crystal nib cut from a single Siberys dragonshard. The quill can be activated as an action, and it can be activated in two 
ways. By twisting the nib clockwise until it clicks once, the quill's first mode is activated. In this mode, the holder of the quill can dictate up to 10 minutes of speech, which the quill will remember. By turning the nib until it clicks once more, the quill becomes inactive. From its inactive state, twisting the nib clockwise until it clicks twice, the quill's second mode activates. While the second mode is active, the quill can be placed upon any blank page, either loose leaf or bound. Once placed, the quill will remain upright and will produce its own ink with which to write. It will transcribe the last speech recorded in its first mode. The quill will automatically turn to a blank page if it requires more room when transcribing to a bound page. If transcribing onto loose leaf, or if it runs out of blank pages in a bound tome, it will pause until a new blank page is placed beneath it. The quill will continue filling up pages, roughly one page per two minutes of speech, until it has finished transcribing the remembered speech. Once the quill has finished transcribing, it will automatically twist the nib clockwise until it clicks once, deactivating itself. A remembered speech remains remembered until it is replaced with a new speech, allowing multiple copies of the same speech to be transcribed. From an inactive state, twisting the nib counter-clockwise until it clicks once will erase any remembered speech. 
Wondrous item, uncommon This wide, black leather band is adjustable so that it can be wrapped and secured around any part of the body. In the center of one side of the belt is a flat-cut khybershard. If the excoriate's band is secured to a dragonmarked creature such that the khybershard is in physical contact with the creature's dragonmark, the creature instantly loses all remaining uses of the ability to cast a spell or spells granted by their dragonmark and cannot regain these uses if the excoriate’s band is still secured to them at the end of any rest. The excoriate's band cannot be removed once secured, unless it is unlocked with a special key. These items were originally commissioned from the Twelve by the King of Galifar in 428 YK, when an infamous excoriate of House Orien used the teleportation powers of their mark to burgle priceless works of art from the Vermishard Palaces of Metrol, and also used their powers to elude capture. Not even the Sentinel Marshals were able to bring in the excoriate, until the first excoriate's bands were created and distributed. Today, most city guards in capitals and large metropolises have at least a couple of excoriate's bands in prominent precincts. 

 
 
 
  
Potion, rare This bottle of magical wine is made from berries created with the goodberry spell, in a process that preserves their healing properties. This magical fermenting technique is known only to one circle of druids that make their home in the Greenhaunt forest of northern Breland. The wine was merely a curiosity and a local delicacy of the hamlet of Hatheril just outside the forest, until the Day of Mourning. Now, the yearly vintage of goodberry wine is a hot commodity with scavengers, the Wayfinder Foundation, and other parties interested in exploring the Mournland, as goodberries and goodberry wine are among the few magical healing effects that still function beyond the dead-gray mists of the Mournland. Because of this high demand among interested parties, a single bottle of goodberry wine can go for as much as 8,000 gp. Each bottle of goodberry wine contains enough wine for 5 glasses. Once consumed, each glass restores 20 hit points (even if the imbiber is inside the Mournland) and provides enough nourishment to sustain a Small or Medium sized humanoid for 24 hours. More importantly for those exploring the Mournland, if the imbiber finishes a long rest within 12 hours of consuming a glass of goodberry wine, they recover hit points and hit dice as normal for finishing a long rest (hit points and hit dice are typically not recovered after long rests within the Mournland). A single creature cannot benefit from more than one glass of goodberry wine in a given 24-hour period. 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) This item is a small disc of metal that can take on the form and decoration of the insignia of an organization. While wearing this insignia, you gain the ability to speak, read, and write one language associated with that organization. A user attuned to this item can change its appearance and associated language over the course of a long rest. 
Wondrous item, uncommon The finest in House Lyrandar elemental airship passenger safety solutions, a lifering is a ring crafted from soarwood. It is about 3 feet in diameter and 4 inches thick, with four fine leather grips evenly spaced around its circumference. Each lifering also has an easily cut cord of twine extended across its hollow center. When the cord is cut as an Action (AC 0, 1 hit point, immune to bludgeoning damage), the lifering is activated for 1 minute. For this duration, the lifering is 
affected as though by the feather fall spell, and bestows this effect on up to four creatures, each grasping one of its four grips. Any creature gains this benefit if they begin holding the lifering at any point while it is active, so they need not be holding the lifering when its twine is cut to gain its benefits. Once a lifering's active duration is expired, it loses all magical properties. This means that the lifering will only protect creatures holding it from a fall of 600 feet or less. A creature falling from a higher distance may attempt to judge the right time to cut a lifering's cord. To do so successfully, they must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the check is a failure, there is a 50% chance the creature cut the cord too soon. In such a case, the lifering's magic properties run out 1 minute later when the lifering is still a number of feet above the ground equal to 10 x the amount by which the creature failed the ability check. (For example, 40 feet if the result of the creature's Wisdom (Perception) was 11). House Lyrandar offers a voucher credit for four free airship tickets for every expended lifering that is returned to a House Lyrandar enclave and is confirmed to be from a ship that reportedly suffered a catastrophe necessitating the lifering's use, as a way of compensation for the inconvenience. Thank you for flying the Lyrandar skies! 
Potion, rarity varies This viscous oil resembles molten gold, though it is cool to the touch. When applied to a construct or warforged, the creature regains hit points. The number of hit points depends on the oil's rarity, as shown below. Whatever its potency, the oil's metallic liquid glimmers when agitated. 
 
Oil of… Rarity HP Repaired Repair Common 1d8 + 3 Greater Repair Uncommon 2d8 + 5 Superior Repair Rare 4d8 + 9 Supreme Repair Very Rare 5d8 + 21 
 
 

 
  
 
 
 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) Quivers of Balinor can appear in a multitude of styles. Some are ornate and studded with Eberron dragonshards to denote their magical appearance, and others are unadorned leather. Whatever its appearance, a quiver of Balinor is always fully stocked with magical arrows. Most of these magical arrows provide no bonus to attack or damage rolls, but once between short rests, you can draw a +3 arrow from the quiver. Any arrow drawn from a quiver of Balinor vanishes 1 round after it is drawn. 
Magic items crafted with Siberys dragonshards can be made to resonate with the innate magic of dragonmarks. Such items universally require attunement by a Dragonmarked character to function. Some will work for any mark, while others require specific ones to function. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Siberys Mark of Passage or a Greater Mark of Passage), very rare House Orien maintains an "Orien Teleportation" enclave with an astral beacon in every major city in the Five Nations. Each astral beacon can be attuned to by any number of qualified individuals and attuning to one astral beacon attunes you to all astral beacons. By doing so you gain an awareness of all other astral beacons. As an action, you can sense the general direction and distance of all astral beacons from you. Attunement to House Orien's astral beacons is reserved for members of House Orien in good standing, and usually includes a contract of dedicated "teleport ferry" service from the individual. A collective of five attuned individuals can perform a special ritual that lasts 1 hour to break the attunement of any other individual. (This is usually a punishment reserved only for Dragonmarked heirs who are excoriated from the House.) While attuned to the astral beacons, when you innately cast teleportation circle from your Mark of Passage, you may target any destination that is within 10 feet of an astral beacon as though it was a permanent teleportation circle you know the sigil sequence for. As the fastest method of travel known to Khorvaire, the services of a Greater- or Siberysmarked Orien heir is in extremely high demand by 
nobles and other Houses and commands a commensurate price. Despite the instantaneous transportation, high demand and rarity of Greater and Siberys marks makes it unlikely that an appropriately marked heir of House Orien will be present in any given city at any time. The wait list for such transportation services varies but waiting one's turn in a teleport queue is almost always faster than travel by other means. An astral beacon is a sphere of silver about twice the size of a human fist, with a Siberys dragonshard embedded in the center. They are often encased in lead and embedded in walls or floors of Siberys Transport enclaves to escape detection and prevent theft or destruction by enemies of House Orien. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Hospitality), rare When attuned to this fine bracelet, you may innately cast Leomund’s tiny hut from your Mark of Hospitality, requiring no components. You may cast this spell once and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Additionally, you gain several enhancements to Leomund’s tiny hut when you cast the spell from your dragonmark: 
 
• The duration of the spell increases to 12 hours. • Instead of creating a dome of force, the spell conjures a small cottage of wood or stone around you that has an area of 20 ft. by 20 ft. The structure has a single story with a ceiling 12 ft. high. The walls of the structure are immune to damage. • The cottage has up to 2 entrances and as many windows as you wish, all of which are filled with planes of force, instead of glass, that behave exactly as the dome of force in a normal casting of Leomund's tiny hut (allowing only creatures that were in the area of the cottage when it appeared to enter and exit, are opaque from the outside but transparent from inside, do not allow spells and magical effects to be extended through them, etc.). • The shelter is conjured with furnishings: eight comfortable beds, eight armchairs, a dining table, a writing desk, a bookshelf, a mirror, and a private washroom with a covered latrine. There is a basin for bathing, but water is not provided. This furniture disappears if it is removed from the structure. • You can set the tone of the décor, including items such as carpets, wall hangings, and other decorations. Like the furniture, these items disappear if removed from the structure. 

 
 
 
  
• You can leave the structure without the spell ending, however one creature originally in the area of the spell when it was cast must remain in the structure. If the structure is ever unoccupied, it disappears and the spell ends. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Passage), rare This silver bracelet sports a tiny, dangling Siberys dragonshard. While attuned to the charm of the long step and wearing it, the distance you can teleport is doubled when you use the Shared Passage trait or cast any spell from the Mark of Passage that allows you to teleport a distance. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Greater or Siberys Mark of Healing), very rare This low marble slab is inlaid with targath and mithral along its sides. Its top surface holds a slightly shallow impression of roughly humanoid shape. The entire slab and weighs 400 pounds and is difficult to move. By expending a use of a spell granted by your Greater or Siberys Mark of Healing, you can innately cast the regenerate spell upon a creature placed atop the slab, instead of the normal spell granted by your dragonmark. The spell functions as normal, except the target must remain on the slap for the entire duration of the spell (1 hour) to regenerate a lost body member, even if the severed member is held against the stump. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Greater or Siberys Mark of Handling), very rare This leather collar is studded with several Siberys dragonshards synced to the Mark of Handling. Each collar is linked to an associated key, a small dragonshard-embedded metal disk. By attuning to the collar of the wild bond, you also attune to its paired key, though both items only count as one toward your magic item attunement limit. While attuned to the collar of the wild bond, you may innately cast the dominate beast spell at-will, requiring no components, but only on a creature wearing the collar. When you cast dominate beast in this way, it has a permanent duration that doesn't require concentration. The dominated creature remains under the effects of the spell until the collar is removed, or if the collar and key are ever more than 60 feet away from each other. Additionally, the target of the spell 
does not gain a new saving throw to resist the spell when it takes damage. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Greater Mark of Storm), very rare This thin circlet of mithral is covered in blue and white enamel in a pattern suggesting a cloudy sky, with points of Siberys dragonshards rising up like a crown. Unlike most magic items, you need to finish a long rest to attune to a crown of high dominion. While attuned to the crown of high dominion and wearing it, you gain several enhancements: 
 
• You may expend a use of a spell granted the Greater Mark of Storm to innately cast control weather instead of the spell usually granted by your greater mark. • When you cast control weather this way, the radius of the spell is 6 miles and the duration does not require concentration and lasts for 48 hours. • You may expend a use of the gust of wind spell granted by the base Mark of Storm to cause significant rain to fall. This rain covers an area centered on you at the time you expend the use of your dragonmark with a radius of 1 mile, and the rain lasts for 1 hour. The rain causes Wisdom (Perception) checks related to sight to be made with disadvantage while in the area. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Greater or Siberys Mark of Shadow), very rare House Phiarlan is world-renown for putting on an amazing performance and employing some of the most talented playwrights over the centuries. However, even with the convenience of modern travel, it is sometimes impossible to leave one's home city to view a Phiarlan play performed with its original cast (as the director intended). Thus, the crystal theater was developed to allow the house's most talented performers to reach more people. Unlike most magic items, up to five qualified individuals may attune to a crystal theater, and attuning to one attunes you to a network of five crystal theaters. Attunement to a network of crystal theaters is usually reserved for members of House Phiarlan of high standing and influence. Three attuned individuals can perform a special ritual that lasts 1 hour to break the attunement of one of the remaining two individuals. (This is usually a punishment reserved only for Dragonmarked heirs who are excoriated from 

 
  
 
 
 
the House. When House Thuranni split from House Phiarlan, House Phiarlan maintained control of all crystal theater networks and any Thuranni scions that were attuned to them had their attunement broken.) Each crystal theater is a massive silver-backed pane of glass, some 20 feet wide by 10 feet tall, magically linked to a crystal ball about 2 feet in diameter. The glass pane and the crystal ball have their magic suppressed while they are ever more than 100 feet away from each other. While attuned to a crystal theater and touching its crystal ball, you may innately cast the scrying spell, but you may only target the location of another crystal theater in the same network. If you do, the scrying spell lasts indefinitely as long as you maintain concentration and remain within 100 feet of the crystal ball. The invisible sensor created by your spell may be up to 100 feet away from the crystal ball of the targeted crystal theater, and its position may be fined tuned by you to attain the maximum view of the stage at the targeted location. The massive glass pane of the crystal theater at your location is the focus for your spell, allowing an audience seated at your location to view a live performance put on at the target location through the surface of the glass. Additionally, all sound within 100 feet of the crystal ball of the targeted crystal theater is also projected from the glass pane of your crystal theater, allowing members of your audience up to 100 feet away to hear the remote performance as well. Phiarlan playhouses that are home to a crystal theater are constructed in such a way that the massive glass pane may be removed to leave the stage unobscured for live performances, and for the projecting of their performances remotely via crystal theaters at other locations. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Detection), very rare This fine brass circlet is trimmed in mithral and has a large Marquise-cut Siberys dragonshard that rests in the center of your forehead when worn. Unlike most magic items, you need to finish a long rest to attune to a diadem of sharpened senses. While attuned to the diadem of sharpened senses and wearing it, you gain several enhancements: 
 
• You can innately cast detect magic and detect poison and disease from your dragonmark as non-ritual spells. You may do so at-will. 
• You can innately cast detect thoughts from your dragonmark twice, requiring no components. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. • You gain proficiency in the Investigation and Perception skills. If you are already proficient in any of these skills, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it. • You receive a +5 bonus to your passive Perception score. • Any time a spell you cast from your Mark of Detection with a casting time of 1 action can be cast as a bonus action instead. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of a true dragonmark), common This amulet set with a small Siberys dragonshard is the most common and simplest kind of dragonshard focus item. Each dragonmark focus is crafted to empower one of the twelve kinds of true dragonmarks, but can be used by a dragonmarked character bearing any level of the mark. When worn by its attuned bearer, the die type of your dragonmarked Intuition Die increases by one (for example, from a d4 to a d6). 
Weapon (quarterstaff), dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of a true dragonmark), very rare This sturdy, magical densewood quarterstaff is banded in iron near both ends and its handgrip is luxuriously wrapped in black leather. The head of each staff is carved in the image of one of the twelve true dragonmarks, mounted directly above a large Siberys dragonshard. Each dragonmarked rod is crafted to empower a bearer of one of the twelve kinds of true dragonmarks. By attuning to and holding a dragonmarked rod associated with your dragonmark, you gain the ability to innately cast the spells associated with the Apex version of your dragonmark (as detailed in the Apex Dragonmark Spells table on page 89), depending on your level. You automatically gain the ability to cast the cantrip and Least spell of your mark. When you reach 6th level, you may cast the Lesser spell granted by your dragonmark. When you reach 14th level, you may cast the Greater spell associated with your mark. When you reach 17th level, you may cast the Siberys spell associated with your mark on the table. Each Least, Lesser, Greater, and Siberys spell can be cast once between long rests. 

 
 
 
  
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of a true dragonmark), uncommon This ring is set with a luminescent Siberys dragonshard, which stores magical energy and allows its attuned wearer to innately cast spells from their dragonmark more often. A dragonshard reservoir is not synced to any single kind of dragonmark, any bearer of any true dragonmark can attune to one of these items. Unlike most magic items, a dragonmark focus item requires a long rest to become attuned to, instead of a short rest. When worn, the dragonshard reservoir allows you to cast any one spell granted by your dragonmark that can only be cast a limited number of times between rests (including spells gained from the Greater Dragonmark feat) an additional time before resting. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Sentinel), rare These helms are forged in many different styles, often commissioned personally by notable members of House Deneith. All helms of the Sentinel are engraved with the Eye of Deneith in several places. While attuned to and wearing a helm of the Sentinel, you may cast contingency as an action. The spell you choose as part of casting contingency can be any spell you can innately cast from your Mark of Sentinel (including spells gained from the Greater Dragonmark feat). You innately cast the spell from your dragonmark as part of casting the contingency spell, expending it until you finish your next short or long rest. If you remove the helm of the Sentinel before the contingency is triggered, both spells are lost. Once you cast contingency from the helm of the Sentinel, it can't be cast again until the next dawn. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (does not require attunement), rare A houseward is a heavy block of alloyed lead with inlays of silver arranged in complex patterns, with a small Siberys dragonshard at its core. This block is often set directly into the floor of a building. The Greater Mark of Warding is required for the creation schema of a houseward, and House Kundarak typically makes a swift business selling these items for 5,000 gp apiece to wealthy individuals looking to secure an ongoing security contract with the House. Unlike most dragonshard focus items, a houseward does not require attunement by a creature 
bearing a specific mark, but it does only respond to several spells innately cast from the Mark of Warding. Whenever the alarm, arcane lock, glyph of warding, nondetection, or Nystul’s magic aura spells are innately cast from a Mark of Warding in an area that includes the houseward, or on an object that is within 20 ft. of a houseward, the duration of the spell increases to 7 days. Likewise, whenever the magic circle or prismatic wall spells are innately cast from a Mark of Warding in the same way, the duration of the spell increases to 24 hours. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Shadow), uncommon An image projector is a 1-foot diameter hoop of silver with a large Siberys dragonshard suspended in its center by copper and gold wires. They were created, ostensibly, to record visual effects to add spectacle and wonder to House Phiarlan stage performances, but they can be used to record any scene. As an action, you can activate an image projector to visually record a scene, either an illusion you create, or all activity within 10 feet of the image projector. The image projector can record up to 1 minute of either scene. After the scene is recorded, you can activate the play back function of the image recorder as an action. The recorded scene replays as a visual illusion above the image projector, with itself as the center of the illusion. No sound is recorded when the image projector is used this way. If you have the Greater or Siberys Mark of Shadow, you may use an image projector to record up to 10 minutes of actual activity or illusion, and the playback includes all sounds recorded during the original scene. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Healing), uncommon, rare, or very rare This device was named after the famed alchemist and artificer, Keoghtom d'Jorasco. It is a loose apparatus of gold bracelets and rings held together with a web of fine mithral links. Suspended in this web are one or more Siberys dragonshards, depending on the hand's rarity. Keoghtom's hands of greater rarities have all the properties of less rare versions. Unlike most magic items, it takes a long rest to attune to a Keoghtom's hand. An uncommon Keoghtom's hand has one large, flat, emerald-cut Siberys dragonshard suspended against your palm when you wear it. As an action, you may 

 
  
 
 
 
innately cast cure wounds from your Mark of Healing while wearing the hand, requiring no components. Once you cast cure wounds this way, you must finish a long rest before you may do so again. Additionally, whenever you cast cure wounds from your Mark of Healing, instead of rolling dice to restore hit points to the target of the spell, you use the highest number possible for each die. A rare Keoghtom's hand has two additional Siberys dragonshards suspended against the back of your hand when you wear it. You can innately cast cure wounds from your dragonmark one additional time while wearing a rare Keoghtom's hand. When you finish a long rest, you regain all uses of cure wounds expended. A very rare Keoghtom's hand has a total of six Siberys dragonshards, the main one held against your palm, and an array of five held against the back of your hand when you wear it. Whenever you innately cast cure wounds from your dragonmark, the spell has a casting time of 1 bonus action while wearing a very rare Keoghtom's hand. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Passage), legendary These long cords of fine leather are regularly studded with alternating Siberys and Khyber dragonshards. They are attached to the helm of a House Orien lightning rail coach, reminiscent of the reins of a mundane coach, and are integral to the operation of the lightning rail. While attuned to the lightning reins, you may telepathically command the air elemental bound to the coach, forcing it to move the coach as you desire. Since the lightning rail follows a line of conductor stones, this is usually limited to deciding the speed of the coach, but an uncontrolled lightning rail coach is bound to "jump the stones" and crash into the ground if speed is not carefully modulated along its route. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Finding), rare When attuned to this short rod wrought of cold iron, as an action you may innately cast locate object from your dragonmark. Once you cast the spell from your dragonmark, you must finish a long rest in order to do so again. Unlike most magic items, it takes a long rest to attune to a prospector’s rod. You gain several enhancements to the locate object spell when you innately cast it from your Mark of Finding: 
 
• The duration of the spell extends indefinitely, as long as you maintain concentration on it. • You may specify a quantity of material to search for: "three or more pounds of adamantine," "one hundred gallons of water," and so on. When you sense the location of the specified material, you can make a DC 10 Wisdom check to estimate the exact quantity of it you've found. • You can sense the location of the specified quantity of material to an increased range, out to a radius of 5 miles. You cannot sense a specific object out to this extended range. (You can find "5 pounds of Eberron dragonshards" out to this distance, but not "the Eberron dragonshard in the pommel of Lord ir’Tain's dagger") 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Making), uncommon, rare, or very rare Crafted for practicality during the Last War, a reparation apparatus is a strange glove-like device that fits over your hand like a fingerless gauntlet, with numerous tools and implements that sprout from it. A large Siberys dragonshard is mounted on a thick band of adamantine at the wrist, with a variable number of smaller Siberys dragonshards studding the circumference of the band depending on the rarity of the reparation apparatus. Rarer varieties of the reparation apparatus have all the properties of less rare versions. Unlike most magic items, it takes a long rest to attune to a reparation apparatus. As an action, you may innately cast repair damage from your Mark of Making while wearing the reparation apparatus, requiring no components. Once you cast repair damage this way, you must finish a long rest before you may do so again. Additionally, whenever you cast repair damage from your Mark of Making, instead of rolling dice to restore hit points to the target of the spell, you use the highest number possible for each die. While attuned to and wearing a rare reparation apparatus, you can innately cast repair damage from your dragonmark one additional time. When you finish a long rest, you regain all uses of repair damage expended. While attuned to and wearing a very rare reparation apparatus, whenever you cast repair damage from your dragonmark, the spell has a casting time of 1 bonus action. 

 
 
 
  
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Handling), very rare This bronzewood rod is capped with a large Siberys dragonshard in a byeshk fitting. While attuned to and holding the scepter of wild dominion, you gain the following enhancements: 
 
• Any spell you innately cast from your Mark of Handling is cast as though from a spell slot three higher than normal. • The saving throw DC to resist any spell innately cast from your Mark of Handling increases by 2. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Greater or Siberys Mark of Shadow), very rare This small, low stone altar is topped with a thin layer of mithral polished to a mirror finish. The reflection cast by its surface is astonishingly clear. The mirror surface is lined with four silver snakes, each holding a golden Siberys dragonshard in their mouths at the corners of the altar. The entire altar and mirror weigh 400 pounds and is difficult to move. Unlike most magic items, up to five qualified individuals may attune to a single serpentine mirror. Attunement to a serpentine mirror is usually reserved for members of House Phiarlan or House Thuranni of high standing and influence. Three attuned individuals can perform a special ritual that lasts 1 hour to break the attunement of one of the remaining two individuals. (This is usually a punishment reserved only for Dragonmarked heirs who are excoriated from the House. When House Thuranni split from House Phiarlan, a purge of all joint attunements from each Houses' serpentine mirrors occurred, so that each House's mirrors were only attuned to by their own people.) While attuned to a serpentine mirror, you may expend a use of any spell granted by the Greater or Siberys Mark of Shadow to cast scrying instead. Whether cast from a Greater or Siberys Mark of Shadow, when you cast scrying using the serpentine mirror as the focus of the spell, the duration of the spell is indefinite as long as you maintain concentration on it, however the spell ends if you move further than 1 foot away from the serpentine mirror. While concentrating on the scrying spell this way, you may choose a new target for the spell as an action, so you may scry on any number of targets with a single casting of scrying from your dragonmark. If a target succeeds on their saving throw, you may not select 
them as a target during the same casting of scrying, or with another casting of scrying within 24 hours. However, the spell does not end if the target succeeds on their saving throw; the mithral surface of the serpentine mirror clouds into dark shadows until you select a new target. Additionally, if the target of the scrying spell voluntarily fails their saving throw, you may cast the message cantrip at-will to speak with them through the serpentine mirror, as long as they remain the target of the scrying spell and you continue to concentrate on it. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (does not require attunement), common These tiny baubles are about the size of real eyes. They are made from two Siberys dragonshards each, bound together with copper bands, and upon closer inspection a hair can be seen pressed between both shards of each shadow eye. Shadow eyes are created in pairs, and each is inexorably linked to the other. Unlike most dragonshard focus items, a shadow eye does not require attunement by a creature bearing a specific mark, but it does only respond to divination spells cast by those who possess the Mark of Shadow. When casting clairvoyance or scrying and holding a shadow eye, you may target the linked shadow eye with your spell, instead of a person or place. If you do, there is no saving throw necessary and no chance for failure, and the range of clairvoyance may be any distance as long as both shadow eyes are on the same plane of existence. Unlike most magic items, shadow eyes are created with magic but are not innately magical themselves, merely serving for a focus for the divination magic cast by a bearer of the Mark of Shadow. As such, they cannot be detected with a detect magic spell, and cannot be identified as what they are with an identify spell. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of a Greater Mark of Making that grants the ability to innately cast fabricate), very rare This anvil is wrought from cold iron, with a complex circular inlay of silver surrounding an array of small Siberys dragonshards encircling one larger Siberys shard. Unlike most magic items, any number of qualified individuals can attune to a sky forge and can remain attuned to it so long as they stay within 1 mile of the sky forge. A collective of five attuned individuals can perform a special ritual that lasts 1 hour to break the attunement of any other individual. (This is usually 

 
  
 
 
 
a punishment reserved only for Dragonmarked heirs who are excoriated from the House.) While attuned to the anvil and standing within 1 mile of it, you can innately cast fabricate from your Greater Mark of Making to affect material within a 100foot cube, or eighty connected 5-foot cubes. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Scribing), common This small marble bust is typically sculpted in the likeness of a famous gnome in House Sivis's history. Unlike most magic items, any number of qualified individuals can attune to a speaking stone and can remain attuned to it so long as they stay within 3 miles of the speaking stone. A collective of five attuned individuals can perform a special ritual that lasts 1 hour to break the attunement of any other individual. (This is usually a punishment reserved only for Dragonmarked heirs who are excoriated from the House.) Speaking stones are an incredible modern marvel and the cornerstone of long-distance communications across Khorvaire. House Sivis has message stations stocked with speaking stones in every major city, and some key smaller settlements, all throughout the Five Nations. Major cities, such as Sharn or a nation's capital, contain multiple House Sivis message stations, and important hub message stations employ more than one speaking stone. While attuned to a speaking stone, you may cast message while touching it and target another speaking stone at another location (you must know the target location of the other speaking stone). When you send a message between speaking stones, it can be of any length, and it travels silently upon the wind at a rate of 1 mile per minute, with no maximum range. When the message reaches the receiving speaking stone, the marble bust animates and speaks your message aloud. There is always a gnome on duty at a House Sivis message station, waiting to transcribe any incoming messages that should arrive. 
Wondrous item, dragonshard focus (requires attunement by a bearer of the Mark of Storm), uncommon These fine, fingerless leather gloves are decorated with crossed lightning bolts on the palms. While attuned to storm gloves, you may innately cast shocking grasp from your Mark of Storm at-will. Additionally, you may expend a use of 1st-level or higher spell granted by any Mark of Storm to innately 
cast thunderwave instead of the spell normally granted by the dragonmark. If you do, thunderwave is cast at a level that matches the expended spell. 
 
Warforged components are magic items that require attunement to a warforged character in order to function. Some components may even require attunement to a warforged of a specific subrace. Unlike other magic items, warforged components physically integrate with the body of an attuned warforged. They cannot be removed, dropped, or disarmed, except from a willing warforged. 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged juggernaut or envoy), uncommon This deep blue metal disc is banded in copper and studded with iron. When attached to your chest, over the course of attunement, adamantine reinforcement spreads through your body. While it is attached, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), rare (+1), very rare (+2), or legendary (+3) This gleaming steel disc is banded in gold and has a number of red dragonshards studded in a ring, the number and size of which increasing with the rarity of the disc. When attached to your chest, over the course of attunement you feel a field of magical force strengthen your armor plates. While it is attached, you have a bonus to AC. The bonus is determined by its rarity. 
 
The armor enhancement disc is designed for warforged that use the Model Type trait detailed in Chapter 1 of this book, instead of the Integrated Armor trait given to them in Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron. Integrated Armor is designed to include the equivalent of +3 magical armor over the course of the warforged’s adventuring career, so this component would essentially double that bonus, skyrocketing the warforged’s AC. Therefore, it is not recommended to allow this component in a game that makes use of warforged racial statistics unaltered from Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron. 
 

 
 
 
  
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), rare (+1), very rare (+2), legendary (+3) This ogre-sized metal gauntlet fits over a warforged's hand and forearm. Over the course of attunement, you feel the battlefist physically lock and integrate into your arm, and your sense of touch extends into the component as if they were your actual arm and hand. You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls on unarmed strikes made with a battlefist. The bonus is determined by the weapon's rarity. Unarmed strikes with a battlefist deal damage as if you had 5 monk levels more than you currently do (minimum 5th level). If this would increase your effective monk level past 20, your unarmed strikes with a battlefist deal 1d12 damage instead of 1d10. While attached, you can use your battlefist as a normal hand, but its large size is a bit clumsier than normal. You have disadvantage when using tools while this component is attached. If you attune to a second battlefist, whenever you use the Attack action to make unarmed strikes with a battlefist, you may make an unarmed strike with the other one as a bonus action (using the improved damage as noted above, including your ability modifier). 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), rare This gold band fits easily over your brow. When it is attached, it fuses with your head, and over the course of attunement you feel your awareness of other warforged around you sharpen. While attached, you gain telepathy with a range of 100 feet, but you can only communicate this way with other warforged. Unlike normal telepathy, you may address any number of warforged within this range at the same time, but they can still only communicate back to you, not with each other. In addition, as a reaction you may grant up to ten warforged within 30 feet of you (including yourself) advantage on saving throws against fear for one round. Once you use this ability, the circlet cannot produce this affect until 1d12 hours have passed. 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), common These copper-rimmed crystal lenses come in a paired set. When placed over your eyes and attuned to, over the course of attunement the lenses lock into place in your eye sockets and form a second layer over your eyes. 
While delver's eyes are attached, you can activate or deactivate them on your turn, requiring no action (but you may only activate or deactivate once per turn). When you activate your delver's eyes, they emit a cone of bright light out to 30 feet, and dim light in an additional 30 feet beyond that. The cone is always emitted in the direction you are looking. 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), uncommon This band of copper is decorated with lacquered soarwood discs. When attached, the copper band melds into your waist until only the soarwood discs are visible. Over the course of attunement, you feel your sense of balance significantly improve. You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to maintain your balance and on all saving throws against any effect that would knock you prone. 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), rare This dull coppery torc bears symbols representing watchfulness. When attached, it hinges open and locks around your neck, and over the course of attunement it melds into your body and you feel your eyesight and hearing sharpen. While attached, you have proficiency with Wisdom (Perception) checks, and you have a +5 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception). 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), rare This dark metal torc is engraved with symbols representing silence and shadow. When attached, it hinges open and locks around your neck, and over the course of attunement it melds into your body. Your metal parts gleam less, the wood and stone of your body hush quietly when you move. While attached, you have proficiency with Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you do not have disadvantage on such checks from a racial trait if you normally do. 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), uncommon This component is an intricate assemblage of clockwork and filigree wings, designed to serve as a communication device within warforged military units. When it is attached, it locks into place in the center of your chest and melds into your body, becoming unnoticeable. Unlike most warforged components, a final messenger attached to your chest slot allows a 

 
  
 
 
 
second warforged component to be attached to the same slot. While attached, you may take an action to implant a destination, a target individual, the image of what you currently can see, and a message of up to 25 words into the messenger. As a bonus action or reaction, you can release the final messenger, at which point it flies to its destination by as direct a route as possible. Opponents within 5 feet of you when you release the messenger may attempt a DC 20 Dexterity check at disadvantage to try and catch it if they have a free hand. If they succeed, the messenger goes dormant and does not attempt to escape. If they fail, the messenger continues on to its intended destination. Once it reaches this location, it seeks the target recipient (if one has been specified); otherwise it looks for the nearest warforged. Any warforged who attempts to attune to a final messenger bearing a message finds that it attaches without attunement and instead delivers the message that it contains. Once delivered, the message disappears from the final messenger, and it can be attuned with. Should a warforged be destroyed while bearing a final messenger, the messenger immediately flies to seek its target. It retains its stored message, but replaces any stored image with a view of the last thing seen by the slain warforged. A final messenger is a Tiny construct with AC 26, 6 hit points, and a fly speed of 60 feet. It has Darkvision 60 ft., and it can take the Dash action as a bonus action on each of its turns. It has no limbs and cannot perform any meaningful action aside from seeking its target and delivering its message, and therefore has a challenge rating of 0 (0 XP). An unattached messenger can remain active for a maximum of 8 hours, after which it becomes inert. It can only replenish its energy by attaching to a warforged; every minute it is attached allows 1 minute of activity after being released, to a maximum of 8 hours. 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), legendary This large emerald-cut sapphire is fitted in a mithral setting, and is the only one of its kind. When attached to your head slot the gem obscures the ghulra on your forehead, and over the course of attunement your ghulra appears within the depths of the sapphire, emitting a dull glow. While attached, you repair 1d6 hit points every 10 minutes, even if you are reduced to 0 hit points or are dead. If you lose a body part, the gem causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after 1d6+1 days. If you are decapitated, 
you die but the gem remains attached unless deliberately removed, and you grow a new fully functional body after 1d6+1 weeks. The gem can be removed while you are at 0 hit points or dead, preventing it from repairing you. Your soul enters the gem immediately if your body dies, or if it is removed while you are at 0 hit points, unless it already houses a soul. You are trapped in the gem so long as it is attached to your dead body or unattached. If a warforged attunes to the gem while it already contains a soul, the two warforged must immediately make contested Charisma saving throws. The victor gains control of the body; the loser is trapped in the gem. This test can be repeated once every 24 hours. As long as a soul is within the gem, it can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it and can perceive the world through the body's senses. A wearer can't prevent this telepathic communication. A wearer can willingly allow the spirit within the gem to take over its body. However, willingly or not, the switch can only occur once every 24 hours. If your soul is within the gem and it is attached to a dead warforged body for 10 minutes, your soul enters the body as soon as it is repaired 1d6 hit points by the gem, even if the body was not your original one. The Gem of Preservation is supernaturally durable. It is immune to nonmagical damage, resistant to all other damage, and has 50 hit points. In addition, it repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 hit point every round. 
Weapon (light crossbow), warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), very rare (+1), or legendary (+2) This light crossbow has a swivel-mount instead of a grip and stock, like a miniature deck-mounted ballista. When the base of the mount is attached to your shoulder, it integrates into your body. When fully attached, the light crossbow can fold up and retract into your shoulder seamlessly. You can retract and deploy the shoulderbow as a bonus action on your turn. While attached and deployed, the shoulderbow can be fired, even if your hands aren't free. You do not have disadvantage on ranged attacks with the shoulderbow even if you are in melee range of an enemy. You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the shoulderbow. The bonus is determined by the weapon's rarity. A shoulderbow magically loads and fires with a thought, ignoring the Loading property of the light crossbow. Moreover, the shoulderbow magically creates bolts to keep the ammunition case located in its mount filled. The case holds 5 bolts at a time: 

 
 
 
  
whenever one bolt is fired, another one is magically created. Bolts vanish if they are removed from the shoulderbow without being shot. The shoulderbow can create 20 bolts per day. You can use your own life energy to create additional bolts, at the cost of 1 hit point per bolt. At any time, you can expend 3d4 hit points to cast conjure barrage as an action. The spellcasting ability for this spell is Constitution. Hit points used to create a bolt or cast conjure barrage are treated just as if you took damage; they can be healed or repaired normally. A shoulderbow cannot use normal bolts (either magical or mundane); it is designed to create and fire its own magical bolts. 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a skirmisher or envoy warforged), uncommon This component is a set of mithral plate greaves with soarwood soles. When attached, they lock into place around your lower legs and the bottoms of your feet. Over the course of attunement, you can feel the greaves meld into your legs and make them feel oddly lighter. While attached, your base walking speed increases by 5 feet, and you are always considered to have a running start when jumping. 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), legendary This belt of woven mithral threads is etched with designs of fabulous beasts and studded with pulsing dragonshards, and is the only one of its kind. When attached, the mithral threads sprout tendrils into your body and integrate with your form. Over the course of attunement, your body rapidly and drastically changes. Your lower body takes on the form of a fantastic leonine beast, a beautiful construct of mithral, steel, and darkwood. While the belt is attached, you can shift between this tauric form and your true form as an action. Your tauric form provides you with a number of advantages. Your size increases to Large for the purposes of most affects (such as grappling or your space if your game uses a combat grid). However, your upper body remains the same size, so you continue to use weapons appropriate for Medium creatures. Your base walking speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain a climbing speed equal to your new walking speed. Your Strength score becomes 27 and your Constitution score becomes 23, if they are not already higher. 
You may make two claw attacks as a bonus action. These are melee weapon attacks that use Strength for their attack roll and deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage. 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), uncommon This metal torc is engraved with runes of warding, and a colored gemstone is set at its front. When attached, it hinges open and locks around your neck. Over the course of attunement, it melds into your body and you feel a thrum of protective energy spread over you. While attached, you have resistance to one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or thunder. Each torc of energy resistance grants resistance to one type of energy, chosen when it was created. 
Warforged component (requires attunement by a warforged), uncommon This component is a set of large metal crampons. When attached, they lock into place around your feet. Over the course of attunement, you can feel the crampons' claws slowly retract into the soles of your feet. While attached, you can extend or retract these claws as a bonus action. When you make a Strength (Athletics) checks to climb a surface (but not a rope) or on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to maintain your balance while these claws are extended, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) This relic has been the cause of much speculation for centuries throughout various esoteric orders—most respectable scholars refuse to admit that such an item even exists in this world. An unassuming cap of black leather, the Baker's hat eludes all known methods of determining any magical properties, but if any of the legends of the hat are true, surely it contains some enchantments. One of the few constants, the experts agree upon, is that by donning the hat, the wearer is filled with all manner of knowledge about the world of Eberron, and driven by its magic to seek out knowledge that few others comprehend or understand. If such legends are true, the wearer of this hat automatically succeeds on all Intelligence checks to recall knowledge about any topic. It is also said, that there is another side to the hat's luck, and that whoever should lose to cap will fall under some grave misfortune in the near future. Rumors hold that Lord ir'Dayne, head of the Wayfinder Foundation, wore the hat as he crossed into the Frostfell, and Baker enthusiasts claim it is the very hat he is seen fanning himself with in a woodcut brought back by his Xen'drik expedition crew. Scuttlebutt in the Wayfinder Foundation hints that their founder's unknown disease set in shortly after losing his dear cap to a thunder lizard stampede escape. The current whereabouts of the Baker's hat are unknown. Lore abounds around infamous figured of history said to have possessed the hat from the pirate Malleon the Reaver to the Loremaster Dorius ir'Korran. The hat usually appears roughly the same in depiction, though variants emerge over time. Scholars love to debate the change of powers in these so called "editions." One Morgrave student claimed that under scrutiny he had determined the hat to be made of leather of a native to Fernia, but his peers quickly laughed away his "hellcow" theory. Common haberdasher tales claim that it is the same hat seen throughout history. Recently, however, a Cannith youth released initial notes on a set of a dozen of these hat's of knowledge, and hinted at an even more mysterious 13th said to be tied to some other world or unreachable place tied to the Prophecy. These findings were unfortunately lost with the Day of Mourning weeks later... Whatever truths are tied to this fashion accessory, it seems the Baker's Hat holds many keys to Eberron.
